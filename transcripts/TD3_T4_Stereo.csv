participant,THIS TIME WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT sp THE NEW SET HAS sp ELEMENTS THAT ARE SHARED BETWEEN TWO SETS SO B INTERSECTION C WOULD sp BE {SL} sp SIX SEVEN EIGHT {SL} SOME BASIC MATH AND PROGRAMMING sp UM AND A sp INTERSECTION C WOULD sp BE AN sp THE NULL SET sp BE AN EMPTY SET sp SINCE NOTHING'S SHARED {SL} CONCEPTS sp sp AND sp I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT sp THE X MEANS sp {LG} sp OK sp THAT'S ALRIGHT {SL} SO FOR WHAT IS THE ROOT NODE sp {SL} UM {SL} DO sp YOU WANT A DEFINITION OR sp WANT THESE QUESTIONS ASSUME ME TO IDENTIFY IT sp UM BOTH sp OK sp UH THE ROOT NODE IS THE sp TOP MOST PARENT {SL} UM OR THE EXACT MIDDLE OF sp THE UM sp {SL} THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BINARY TREE sp WHICH IS WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS THE ROOT NODE IN THIS CASE IS FIFTY sp OK sp WHAT IS THE PARENT NODE OF NINETEEN sp UH THE PARENT NODE THESE MATHEMATICAL THEORIES OF NINETEEN IS TWENTY THREE sp {SL} OK sp WHAT ARE THE CHILD NODES OF SEVENTY TWO {SL} UH sp FIFTY FOUR ER sp FIFTY FOUR sp UM SIXTY SEVEN AND SEVENTY SIX {SL} OK AND WHAT ARE THE SIBLING NODES OF TWELVE sp {SL} UM {SL} TWENTY THREE sp {SL} PLEASE EXPLAIN THE QUESTION OK {SL} sp WHAT AND ANSWER IT sp SPECIAL TYPE OF FUNCTION IS sp THIS {BR} {SL} sp UH THIS IS A RECURSIVE FUNCTION sp UM A FUNCTION THAT CALLS ITSELF WITHIN ITSELF KIND OF LIKE YOU'RE TUTORING ME sp {SL} sp UM {SL} sp HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LOOP TO INFINITY UNLESS THERE IS SOME SORT OF BREAK IN THERE sp SUCH AS WHAT YOU HAVE THERE sp IF sp MHM sp AND Y EQUALS EQUALS ZERO {SL} sp UM sp AND THIS FUNCTION I WOULD ASSUME RETURNS THE GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR BETWEEN TWO sp TWO INTEGERS AGAIN IF YOU'RE NOT SURE {SL} OK sp GREAT sp AND WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO sp {LG} sp UM sp RETURNS WHAT THE ANSWER IS PLEASE TRY THE GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR BETWEEN sp TWO INTEGERS X AND Y sp OK sp GREAT {SL} TO GUESS sp AND WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} THIS IS A THIS sp IS A SORT {SL} IF YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANY ANSWER UM sp THIS SORTS A LIST A sp UM sp SO THAT THE VALUES ARE IN ORDER {SL} OK sp AND WHAT IS THE FORMAL YOU CAN TELL ME THAT YOU WANT NAME FOR THIS sp TYPE OF FUNCTION sp OH sp GOD {SL} sp I sp ALWAYS GOOF UP sp BUBBLE AND SELECTION TO SKIP sp THE QUESTION sp ALRIGHT SORT sp IT'S ONE OF THOSE {SL} THINK IT'S A SELECTION SORT {SL} BUT I'M sp I COULD BE WRONG sp OK sp sp OK sp THAT'S ALRIGHT {SL} sp OH GOD sp {LG} sp OK sp EXPLAIN EACH OF THE SYMBOLS ON THE LEFT {BR} sp GREAT sp {SL} {BR} {SL} OK sp THEN sp UM CAN I SKIP THIS QUESTION {LG} SURE sp SURE sp UM USING THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE RIGHT CREATE AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE sp AND YOU CAN DEFINE THE VARIABLES WE ARE GOING TO START HOWEVER YOU WANT sp CAN I SKIP THAT QUESTION AS WELL YEP I CAN'T I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT ANY OF THOSE SYMBOLS MEAN sp THAT'S OK sp THAT'S TOTALLY FINE {SL} OFF JUST BY CALIBRATING ON A WEBSITE THIS WOULD PRODUCE sp WHAT DOES EXAMPLE A B AND sp C LOOK LIKE sp {SL} UM {SL} A WOULD THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES sp TAKE THE UM {SL} A IS IN sp EXAMPLE A IS IN A HEADER TAG ER sp A HEADER ONE TAG SO sp IT'D BE sp IT'D HAVE THE FONT ARIAL AGAIN {SL} sp IT'D BE PINK sp UM sp ER sp ITS BACKGROUND WOULD BE PINK AND ITS COLOR WOULD BE RED sp UM HEADER TWO sp ITS COLOR WOULD BE BLUE AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE A BACKGROUND COLOR sp ER IT WOULD HAVE THE DEFAULT BACKGROUND COLOR sp {SL} UM sp AND IT WOULD BE CENTERED sp AND C WOULD TAKE ON THE UM {SL} THE UM sp PROPERTY IT WOULD HAVE A BACKGROUND COLOR OF YELLOW AND IT WOULD BE GREEN sp UH THE TEXT WOULD BE GREEN {SL} OK sp GREAT {SL} DESCRIBE TO ME USING THE PICTURE WHAT A LOOP IS {SL} sp UM {SL} IN A FINITE STATE MACHINE {SL} sp CAN'T REMEMBER {SL} CAN I SKIP THIS ONE sp SURE sp NO sp EXCELLENT PROBLEM sp {SL} UM sp HOW MANY LOOPS ARE THERE IN THIS PICTURE {SL} ONE sp {SL} I BELIEVE sp OK {SL} sp AND WHAT WOULD CALL THE ZERO VERTEX {SL} NOT SURE IF sp YOU sp CONSIDER THAT A TERMINATOR OR NOT EVEN PART OF THE MACHINE sp SINCE IT'S NOT CONNECTED SINCE IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO ANYTHING {SL} OK sp GREAT {SL} sp DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS HERE {SL} UH sp THESE ARE NUTRITION FACTS sp FOR UM sp A BREAKFAST MENU {SL} sp UM sp SO SOME SORT OF RESTAURANT THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE sp BELGIAN WAFFLES AND STRAWBERRY BELGIAN WAFFLES sp UM sp EACH ELEMENT WOULD HAVE A sp NAME sp A PRICE sp A DESCRIPTION sp AND A CALORIE COUNT sp SINCE sp WELCOME TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN sp {SL} sp OK sp WHAT TYPE OF CODING IS sp THIS sp UM {SL} sp I MEAN I'D ARGUE AGAINST CALLING IT CODING BUT IT'S UM IT'S HTML sp NO IT'S XML sp {SL} sp XML sp {SL} OK sp AND WHAT IS A BENEFIT OF CODING INFORMATION THIS sp WAY {SL} sp UM {SL} sp GIVES UM {SL} GIVES A READABLE STRUCTURE TO THE UM sp THE INFORMATION YOU'RE MAINTAINING {SL} sp IT'S ALSO GREAT IF YOU REALLY LIKE sp BLOATED FILE TYPES {SL} sp UM OK {SL} WHAT TYPE OF GRAPH IS sp THIS {SL} WHAT TYPE OF GRAPH sp MHM sp I DON'T REMEMBER THE THE sp DIFFERENT TYPES OF GRAPHS {SL} OK sp THAT'S ALRIGHT sp WHAT IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM sp SEVEN TO TWO {SL} sp UM {SL} sp IT'D BE UH SEVEN TO EIGHT sp TO SIX TO TWO {SL} sp GREAT sp WHAT IS A CYCLE sp ALSO CALLED A ROUTE OR A TOUR {SL} sp UM sp {SL} PRETTY SURE A CYCLE IS sp WHEN {SL} sp WELL sp UM sp WHEN sp THE BEST PATH ER WHEN UM {SL} THERE'S A PATH THAT EXISTS THAT CAN TAKE YOU BACK TO YOURSELF {SL} SO SEVEN TO EIGHT TO SIX TO SEVEN {SL} OK sp HOW MANY CYCLES ARE IN THIS GRAPH {SL} HM {SL} sp ONE sp TWO {SL} sp THINK ONLY TWO {SL} YEAH {SL} sp NO WAIT sp THREE {SL} LET'S SEE THEN THREE {SL} OK sp GREAT {SL} THIS IS A LIST OF SOME BIG O NOTATIONS FOR ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY sp SO GIVING NAMES AND EXAMPLES WHERE YOU CAN sp DESCRIBE TO ME THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPLEXITIES sp {SL} ALRIGHT {SL} UM {SL} sp O ONE IS sp THE BEST CASE sp NO MATTER HOW MANY ELEMENTS YOU HAVE IN A SET sp IT WILL TAKE sp O AMOUNT OF TIME TO COMPLETE sp NO MATTER WHAT THE SIZE THIS IS sp THE BEST sp POSSIBLE TIME COMPLEXITY sp UM {SL} sp O N FACTORIAL IS ON THE LEFT sp DEPENDENT ON THE NUMBER OF UM {SL} UM sp ELEMENTS IN THE LIST sp IT'LL TAKE sp THAT MANY FACTORIAL sp TIMES sp ARE EXPRESSIONS HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES TO DO ONE PASS sp FOR sp TO {SL} COMPLETE THE ALGORITHM sp THAT'S sp A sp VERY LONG sp TIME sp IT'S NOT PRACTICAL sp AND ON THE RIGHT FOR LARGE SETS sp ER sp OR sp ANY SETS AT ALL sp IT'S KIND OF THE WORST CASE FOR ANY ALGORITHM YOU KIND OF WANT TO AVOID THAT {SL} O N IS LINEAR ARE SETS {SL} sp SO sp AS THE NUMBER OF UM sp ITEMS IN A SET INCREASE sp THE sp UH THE TIME IT sp TAKES TO COMPLETE THE ALGORITHM INCREASES LINEARLY {SL} O LOG N sp IS {SL} UM sp A LOGARITHMIC PROGRESSION sp SO sp AS YOU GET INTO VERY LARGE SETS sp IT'LL TAKE A {SL} INDES- sp ON THE LEFT WHAT IN- sp A UM sp A NOT REALLY sp AN INSIGNIFICANT UM sp DIFFERENCE OF TIME sp VERSUS UM {SL} THE NEXT SECTION IS VERY DO THE U UPSIDE SOME NUMBER sp WITH UM SOME UH SOME NUMBER OF THE ALGORITHM sp SET sp {LG} SMALLER THAN THE ALGORITHM sp WHAT {SL} DOWN U sp AND X AND THEN UM sp O N SQUARED IS sp UM A QUADRATIC PROGRESSION {SL} OK sp AND WHICH TYPE OF COMPLEXITY IS BEST sp AND WHY sp UM sp SYMBOLS MEAN {SL} {SL} sp DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION sp UM sp IF YOU'RE IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE WORKING WITH REALLY LARGE SETS sp AND YOU CAN AVOID UM {SL} UM sp {SL} UH GETTING WRAPPED UP IN YOURSELF FOR RECURSION sp O LOG N IS sp REALLY PRACTICAL FOR sp FOR INCREDIBLY UM sp LARGE SETS sp {SL} IF YOU'RE JUST WORKING WITH A SMALLER THING UM sp A SMALLER SET sp A PRACTICAL sp A PERFECTLY PRACTICAL SOLUTION WOULD JUST BE AN THE U IS O N SQUARED sp UM OR AN O N sp COMPLEXITY {SL} sp OK sp GREAT {SL} UNION SO THE WHAT IS A VERTEX sp AND HOW MANY VERTICES ARE THERE {SL} sp A VERTEX IS sp ANY POINT WHERE sp TWO EDGES MEET sp ER sp WHERE AN EDGE COMBINED sp sp YEAH WHERE TWO EDGES MEET sp SO THERE ARE sp EIGHT VERTICES IN THIS {SL} UM THE SET OK sp WHAT IS AN EDGE AND HOW MANY EDGES ARE THERE sp AN EDGE IS ANY sp ER ANY UM sp LINK sp BETWEEN TWO VERTICES sp THERE ARE sp {SL} THAT'S THE sp RESULTANT TWELVE {SL} OK sp HOW LONG IS THE SHORTEST PATH sp FROM ONE TO sp SIX {SL} SIMILAR TO WHAT WE JUST sp OF UM {SL} TWO {SL} ONE TO FIVE TO SIX ONE TO TWO TO SIX sp COMBINING TWO {SL} OK sp GREAT sp AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT sp THREE AND TWO ARE ADJACENT {SL} sp THEY HAVE AN EDGE LINKING THEM TOGETHER sp {SL} SETS sp SO OK sp GREAT sp THAT WAS THE LAST QUESTION sp SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO CALIBRATE THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES ONE MORE TIME REAL QUICK OK sp AND THEN WE'RE sp ALMOST DONE {SL} A UNION B WOULD BE sp ONE TWO THREE FOUR ALRIGHT sp THEN YOU'RE ALL SET sp SO YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES OFF AGAIN sp FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT IN THAT ORDER {SL} UM {SL} sp DID sp EXCEPT B INTERSECTION sp ER UPSIDE DOWN U IS INTERSECTION sp SO sp ANYTHING ANY UM sp THE RESULTANT SET WHERE
