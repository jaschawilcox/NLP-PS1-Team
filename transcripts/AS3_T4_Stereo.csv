participant,sp NEXT SECTION LIKE AND EIGHT sp WHAT sp OK sp MAKES sp SENSE {SL} sp WHAT sp KIND OF GRAPH IS sp THIS {SL} sp DIRECTED sp I YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING MEAN sp IT'S DIRECTED BECAUSE EVERY NODE HAS sp IS POINTING TO ANOTHER NODE {SL} BUT {SL} AND IT'S ALSO DIRECTED BECAUSE {SL} IS THAT {SL} AS IT'S sp AS sp BECAUSE YOU SEE ARROWS sp AND IT HAS ARROWS BECAUSE IT HAS ARROWS sp IT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH sp OK {SL} WHAT IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM sp SEVEN TO TWO sp {BR} sp OH THERE'S NO WEIGHTS ON EACH EDGES THAT'S REALLY A TOUGHIE TO SAY sp UM {SL} I MEAN WITH THESE ELEMENTS sp IF YOU'RE JUST SOLELY BASING THIS ON sp HOW TO GET THERE sp QUICKLY sp OH OR THE ONLY WAY sp FOR THAT MATTER YOU CAN ONLY GET THERE sp YOU'RE sp FOR THIS SITUATION sp UH sp BECAUSE OF HOW sp THESE GRAPHS ARE DIRECTED WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CANNOT GO THE REVERSE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE ARROW POINTS sp CONJOINING THEM I'D HAVE TO SAY FIRST TRAVEL FROM NODE SEVEN TO NODE EIGHT sp THEN FROM NODE EIGHT TO NODE SIX sp THEN FROM NODE SIX TO NODE TWO {SL} sp OK sp {SL} TOGETHER YOU'RE COMBINING WHAT IS A sp CYCLE sp ALSO CALLED A ROUTE sp OR A sp TOUR {SL} THEM TOGETHER IT'S BASICALLY WHEN YOU UH SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE {SL} sp IF YOU'RE sp IF YOU'RE sp IF THIS HAS sp WEIGHTS sp YOU'RE GONNA BE YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO TRY TO FIND AN ALGORITHM TO FIND THE sp SHORTEST PATH LET'S SAY FROM NODE A TO NODE I SAID IS VERY SIMILAR sp ONE NEW B {SL} sp OK SO WHAT A CYCLE IS IS BASICALLY sp IF SOMEHOW DURING THE ALGORITHM THEY sp THE ALGORITHM SOMEHOW sp SET {SL} LEAPS UP sp AND UH {SL} IS TRYING TO FIND TWO INSTANCES OF A SHORTEST PATH sp THEN THERE'S GONNA BE A CYCLE sp BECAUSE IN WHICH IT CONTAINS {SL} BECAUSE sp THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE PATH sp FROM sp A TO B sp AND IF THERE IS ANOTHER NODE sp ELEMENTS FROM THAT'S sp TRYING TO sp INTERFERE WITH THAT PATH PER SE OR CONNECT sp TO THAT PATH sp UH sp EVEN THOUGH IT HAS ALREADY BEEN VISITED ONCE BUT IT'S TRYING TO BE VISITED A SECOND BOTH sp A sp TIME sp THAT IS CONSIDERED A CYCLE sp OK sp HOW MANY CYCLES ARE IN THIS GRAPH sp {SL} AND sp BOTH sp B AND IF THERE'S A REPEAT I'M GONNA SAY {SL} sp sp THEN THAT THERE ARE sp {SL} sp FOUR WHICH ARE NODES TWO THREE sp IT'S JUST {SL} SEVEN AND NINE BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE THAN ONE sp ARROW POINTING AT sp THEM {SL} sp OK sp GREAT {SL} IT THIS IS A LIST OF SOME BIG O NOTATIONS FOR ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY YES sp SO GIVING NAMES AND EXAMPLES WHERE YOU CAN sp DESCRIBE TO ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPLEXITIES {SL} TO WHAT WE JUST sp DID sp IT WON'T BE SO sp O OF ONE sp WHICH IS sp {BR} IN MODERN TIMES THEY sp SUCH DOES NOT EXIST BUT O OF ONE IS BASICALLY UM sp A REPEAT A sp COMPLEXITY IT ONLY TAKES sp ONE SECOND sp TO COMPUTE sp UH sp FOR THAT ALGORITHM sp O OF N FACTORIAL WHICH IS WHAT THE EXCLAMATION IN THE NEW SET POINT MEANS IS THAT IT TAKES sp UH sp YOU HAVE TO sp MULTIPLY sp N sp UH sp N MINUS N MINUS sp N MINUS ONE TIMES ALL sp UM THE WAY UP TO ONE sp SO YOU HAVE TO SAY LET'S SAY N IS EQUAL TO FIVE YOU'D GO FIVE BY FOUR BY THREE BY TWO BY ONE sp THAT WOULD BE THE COMPLEXITY sp O OF N sp THE UPSIDE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD sp JUST {SL} IT'S AS sp THE sp TIME IT TAKES TO DO THE ACTUAL ALGORITHM IS sp EQUAL TO sp N ITSELF sp UH DOWN U FOR LOG N O OF LOG N sp THEN IT'S EQUAL TO THE LOGARITHMIC VALUE sp BASE sp TWO {SL} I BELIEVE YES sp OF WHAT sp IS sp N'S VALUE IS EVEN IF N'S VALUE IS IN BASE TEN sp AND sp STRAIGHTFORWARD sp WITH N SQUARED IT TAKES sp N SQUARED SECONDS TO COMPLETE THE ALGORITHM {SL} DIS- sp DISJOINT OK sp WHICH TYPE OF COMPLEXITY IS BEST sp AND WHY {SL} sp SO WHAT sp IN THE IDEAL SENSE IT WOULD BE O OF ONE sp HOWEVER THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL FOR sp FOR ALL PURPOSES NECESSARY sp SO IN MODERN TIMES sp THAT BASICALLY MEANS PEOPLE WOULD GO WITH O OF LOG sp N sp BECAUSE LOG N sp IS sp BASICALLY A VALUE THAT IS LESS THAN sp N WHEREAS ALL THE OTHER VALUES EXCEPT THIS TIME WE'LL BE TALKING sp IS sp ARE EITHER EQUAL TO sp OR GREATER THAN N sp BUT OF COURSE IN THE IDEAL WORLD O OF ONE sp WOULD BE MOST {SL} sp IDEAL FOR ALL YOU HAVE sp TO ALGORITHMS NO MATTER WHAT sp BUT {SL} sp GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S O OF LOG N BECAUSE IT HAS THE sp {SL} sp SMALLEST NUMERIC VALUE {SL} sp OK sp MAKES BE ABLE TO FIND SENSE sp {SL} sp WHAT IS A VERTEX sp AND HOW MANY VERTICES ARE THERE {SL} sp A VERTEX IS sp BASICALLY sp TWO sp A CONNECTED A CONNECTION POINT BETWEEN sp UH {SL} EACH EDGE sp ELEMENTS OF A SET OR IT COULD BE LIKE {SL} sp YES IT'S IT'S UM sp {BR} sp {SL} sp IN BOTH sp SETS sp YES sp A VERTEX IS BASICALLY sp THAT ARE sp EQUAL A LINE THAT CONNECTS EACH EDGE sp OR A sp NODE WHICH IS sp THE TERM sp I HAD PREVIOUSLY USED SO IN THIS PICTURE sp THERE ARE sp TWELVE sp VERTICES {SL} IN VALUE sp OK sp WHAT IS AN sp EDGE sp AND HOW MANY EDGES sp ARE THERE sp AN EDGE IS THE TERM I USED FOR NODE SO IT'S BASICALLY sp IN THIS CASE sp WHAT sp SO FOR B sp IS REPRESENTED AS THE COLORED CIRCLES AND THERE ARE A TOTAL OF sp EIGHT sp {SL} sp HOW LONG IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM ONE TO sp SIX {SL} ABOUT sp SOME BASIC MATH AND C sp sp I MEAN BECAUSE THE VERTICES ARE NOT WEIGHTED sp I E THEY HAVE NO NUMERICAL VALUE BECAUSE YOU YOU'VE TO THEM {SL} UH IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL SO ONE COULD SAY PERHAPS IT'S FROM ONE TO FIVE TO SIX OR FROM ONE TO TWO TO SIX sp GOT ELEMENTS FOUR FIVE BUT REALLY sp THERE'S NO FAIR WAY OF sp JUSTIFYING WHICH IS THE SHORTEST PATH IN THIS IMAGE BECAUSE sp THERE'S NO WEIGHTS ON THE VERTICES {SL} sp OK sp SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT sp THREE AND TWO ARE ADJACENT sp {SL} sp {BR} sp sp {SL} ESSENTIALLY {SL} AS THE NAME SUGGESTS THEY ARE JUST NEXT TO EACH OTHER THEY ARE CONNECTED SOMEHOW sp THEY HAVE A BOND sp SO IN THIS CASE THIS BOND sp IS A VERTICE THAT IT'S GONNA BE CONNECTS BETWEEN TWO AND THREE {SL} sp OK sp {SL} sp GREAT {SL} ALRIGHT sp SO THAT'S sp IT sp UM FOR THE QUESTIONS SO WE JUST NEED TO FOR sp B HAVE YOU CALIBRATE THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES ONE MORE TIME AND THEN WE'RE ALMOST sp DONE sp OK {SL} AND C IT'S GONNA BE UNION SIX ALRIGHT sp SO WE ARE ALL DONE sp UM YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND sp SEVEN EIGHT AND PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS sp I MEAN sp DISJOINT sp EXCUSE ME DISJOINT sp WHY BECAUSE THIS IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT WE WANNA FIND sp ELEMENTS IN BOTH sp B AND C sp sp YES sp SO UM sp IN BOTH IN BOTH {SL} UH SETS WE WANNA FIND ELEMENTS THAT ARE THE SAME IN BOTH sp B AND C LIKEWISE WITH sp A sp AND C SO THAT'S ANOTHER DISJOINT FOR THESE QUESTIONS ASSUME {SL} sp THAT'S JUST GONNA BE UH {SL} UM {SL} NULL sp SO IT'S JUST LIKE A ZERO WITH A SLASH THROUGH IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ELEMENT BE sp BETWEEN A AND C THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME sp AND THE X sp IT'S JUST YOUR STANDARD UH sp UM {SL} MULTIPLICATION THESE MATHEMATICAL sp THEORIES SO UH sp HOW YOU MULTIPLY SETS sp IS YOU BASICALLY UH {SL} sp IT'S A DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY SO FIRST YOU DO sp X {SL} sp YES sp sp FIRST YOU UH START WITH sp X SO LIKE sp X PLUS TWO X PLUS THREE X sp PLUS sp X PLUS sp Y X sp TWO Y PLUS UM sp PLUS THREE Y BECAUSE YOU ARE SO PLEASE EXPLAIN THE QUESTION sp DISTRIBUTING sp BETWEEN sp THE TWO THE THREE ELEMENTS IN SET A AND THE TWO ELEMENTS IN SET sp B sp TO {SL} GET A PRODUCT {SL} AND ANSWER IT sp OK {SL} GREAT sp SO GIVEN THE SETS ON THE RIGHT sp WHAT SETS WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE LEFT {SL} sp UH LIKE YOU'RE TUTORING ME sp sp I THINK I STATED THIS EARLIER BEFORE BUT A UNION B sp IS WOULD BE CONTAIN THE SET ELEMENTS sp ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT sp {BR} OK sp OK OK sp B DISJOINT C sp {BR} sp WOULD JUST CONTAIN ELEMENTS SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT sp A DISJOINT C IS NULL BECAUSE BOTH SETS DON'T HAVE EQUAL VALUES AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE NOT SURE AND A TIMES D IS sp X PLUS TWO X PLUS THREE X sp PLUS Y PLUS TWO Y PLUS THREE Y sp OK sp GREAT {SL} sp WHAT THE ANSWER IS sp PLEASE TRY WHAT IS sp THE ROOT NODE sp {SL} sp FIFTY sp OK sp AND WHAT IS THE PARENT NODE OF NINETEEN {SL} TWENTY TO GUESS sp AND THREE {SL} sp OK sp WHAT ARE THE CHILD NODES OF sp SEVENTY TWO {SL} sp FIFTY FOUR AND SEVENTY SIX {SL} sp OK sp IF YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY UNSURE AND WHAT ARE THE sp SIBLING NODES OF TWELVE {SL} NEVER HEARD THAT TERM BUT ON GOOD FAITH I'M GONNA SAY TWENTY THREE sp OK {SL} GREAT {SL} JUST TELL ME THAT YOU WANNA WHAT sp SPECIAL TYPE OF FUNCTION IS sp THIS {SL} sp WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SPECIAL {SL} SKIP THE sp QUESTION OH YEAH ALRIGHT sp UM IT'S UP TO YOU sp {BR} sp I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PER SE sp BUT sp FAIR ENOUGH sp ONE MIGHT BE ABLE TO THINK THAT THIS MIGHT BE UH {SL} NOT EXACTLY UH {SL} sp UM sp TYPICAL WAY ALRIGHT THEN WE OF sp PROGRAMMING sp SO sp {SL} YOU SEE YOU NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE UH AN ELSE STATEMENT THAT SAYS RETURN GCD Y sp X PERCENT SIGN ARE GOING TO START Y sp WHAT THAT PERCENT SIGN BASICALLY MEANS IS MOD sp SO YOU'RE BASICALLY sp MOD ESSENTIALLY IS sp BETWEEN X MOD Y sp IS BASICALLY YOU'RE OFF AGAIN BY CALIBRATING sp UM {SL} sp HOW DO I PUT sp THIS sp YOU'RE UH DIVIDING UH {SL} THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES X WITH sp Y {SL} AND WITHIN THAT VALUE YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND THE sp THE sp REMAINDER OF {SL} UM sp WE'LL DO THAT sp QUICKLY sp X AND Y SO LET'S SAY X IS EQUAL TO sp I DON'T KNOW sp NINE AND Y IS EQUAL TO sp TWO sp SO {SL} sp IF YOU DIVIDE THOSE sp THEN YOU'LL GET A REMAINDER OF sp ONE IN sp WHICH CASE Y Y'S NEW VALUE FOR {SL} sp G sp FOR GCD AS THE FIRST sp UH sp ARGUMENT sp THAT WOULD EQUAL TO {SL} sp EXCUSE ME sp UM ONE sp AND THEN YOU JUST CONTINUE THROUGH THIS FUNCTION sp {SL} sp FROM THE TOP sp AT GCD {SL} sp OK sp GREAT sp AND WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO sp UM CALCULATES THE GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR sp OF {SL} UH {SL} sp TWO NUMBERS WHICH I'M PRESUMABLY GONNA ASSUME IS ONE NUMERATOR AND IS ONE DENOMINATOR sp X AND Y RESPECTIVELY {SL} OK sp GREAT {SL} WHAT DOES sp THIS FUNCTION sp DO {SL} sp SO IT'S BASICALLY JUST TRYING TO UH {SL} IT'S sp BASICALLY SWAPPING {SL} UM sp TWO VALUES IF sp IF THEY'RE sp LIKE sp IN AN ORDERED sp ARRAY sp IF THERE IS ONE VALUE IN THE ARRAY THAT IS GREATER IF sp IF sp IF THE FIRST VALUE OF THE ARRAY IS GREATER THAN THE sp NEXT VALUE sp BOTH sp VALUES sp SHOULD BE SWAPPED sp SO AS TO UH sp BE IN UH sp CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER {SL} OK sp AND WHAT IS THE FORMAL NAME FOR THIS sp TYPE OF FUNCTION {SL} sp I MEAN sp GENERALLY SPEAKING I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED SORT sp BUT FROM THIS ALGORITHM IT SEEMS AS IF IT'S CLOSE TO sp WHAT A BUBBLE SORT sp IS sp OK sp GREAT sp {SL} EXPLAIN EACH OF sp THE sp SYMBOLS sp ON THE LEFT sp OK sp SO sp THE sp UPSIDE DOWN CAPITAL A sp IS THE U- IS THE UH sp UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIER sp WHICH MEANS THAT sp THERE IS AN ELEMENT FOR sp IF YOU PUT THAT sp IF YOU PUT THAT QUANTIFIER IN FRONT OF sp A VARIABLE sp WHAT THAT BASICALLY MEANS sp IS sp {SL} IT APPLIES TO ALL OF THIS VARIABLE NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE IS sp AND THE BACKWARDS CAPITAL sp THE REVERSE CAPITAL E sp THAT'S AN sp EXISTENTIAL sp QUANTIFIER AND THAT'S HOW I LIKE TO THINK OF IT sp E BEGINS WITH EXISTENTIAL sp ANYWAYS sp UH SO WHAT THAT JUST MEANS sp IS sp {BR} sp THERE HAS TO BE CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT ARE MET IN ORDER FOR sp THAT sp FUNCTION sp UH I MEAN FOR THAT VARIABLE sp CONTAINING THAT QUANTIFIER TO TAKE PLACE SO IT'S GOTTA BE sp CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IT HAS TO BE YOU KNOW sp MAYBE LESS THAN THIS NUMBER GREATER THAN THAT NUMBER sp WHATEVER sp SO THE CAPITAL V sp STANDS FOR sp IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS ANYWAYS IT STANDS FOR sp OR sp SO sp IN A TRUTH SO THIS IS BASICALLY GONNA GO TO I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT TRUTH TABLES sp OR VALUES REPRESENT BOOLEAN VARIABLES AND BOOLEAN VARIABLES sp ARE sp THEY SOUND INTIMIDATING BUT THEY ARE JUST SIMPLY sp SOMETHING IS EITHER TRUE sp OR SOMETHING IS sp FALSE sp OR sp IN UM sp BINARY INTEGER OPERATIONS ZERO AND ONE RESPECTIVELY sp SO YOU'RE BASICALLY JUST SAYING UM sp IF SOMETHING sp IF sp ZERO sp OR ONE sp THEN IT'S ONE sp AND THE REASON FOR THAT ALRIGHT sp YEP sp IS sp AND THEN EVERY EVERYTHING ELSE SHOULD BE sp {SL} sp FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD sp IF YOU'RE JUST SAYING LIKE UH {SL} sp ZERO OR ONE sp ONE OR ZERO sp IT'S sp UM sp {SL} ONE IN BOTH CASES AND THE REASON IS sp BECAUSE {SL} sp UH sp IN BOTH CASES YOU STILL HAVE AN ELEMENT THAT IS TRUE SO THEREFORE sp IT'S GONNA BE TRUE {SL} WHAT LOOKS LIKE THAT WHAT LOOKS LIKE A CARET SYMBOL sp UM IN sp LITERATURE LITERARY EDITING sp THAT BASICALLY STANDS FOR sp AND sp AND IT'S sp {SL} ESSENTIALLY THE THE UH {SL} sp CONTRARY TO WHAT sp OR IS SO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OR ZERO ZERO OR ONE IS EQUAL TO ZERO sp JUST BECAUSE sp {SL} sp BOTH CONDITIONS ARE NOT EQUALLY {SL} sp IDENTICAL TO EACH OTHER SO IT'S sp FALSE BOTH CONDITIONS WILL BE FALSE AT THAT sp POINT sp SO THE ARROW THERE JUST MEANS sp UM sp AN IMPLICATION STATEMENT sp IT'S SIMPLY JUST sp IF THERE IS {SL} sp IF THERE IS A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENS TO THE LEFT OF THE AREA sp ARROW sp EXCUSE ME sp THEN sp THERE'S ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE RIGHT OF THE ARROW sp THAT'S GOING TO sp UH sp TAKE PLACE FOR ON THE LEFT ARE EXPRESSIONS {SL} sp UH {SL} sp FOR WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEFT OF THE ARROW sp {SL} OK {SL} GREAT sp SO USING THE EXPRESSIONS sp YES AND ON THE RIGHT sp CREATE sp AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE sp AND YOU CAN DEFINE THE VARIABLES sp HOWEVER YOU WANT sp OK {SL} sp OK sp ON THE RIGHT ARE SETS {SL} I'M GONNA GO WITH THE FIRST EXAMPLE AND I'M GONNA SAY FOR ALL sp HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH {SL} IF ONE HUMAN BEING DECIDES TO HAVE sp AN AFFAIR AND CHEAT ON HIS OR HER GIRLFRIEND OR WIFE OR WHATNOT sp THEN {SL} sp THEY ARE {SL} sp THEY ARE DOOMED FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE ON THE LEFT sp BY sp BEING HAUNTED sp BY WHAT THEY HAVE DONE {SL} OR sp OR ANOTHER SITUATION COULD BE FOR P OF X {SL} WHAT DO THE U THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTNER DECIDES TO DUMP THEM {SL} sp OK {SL} sp GREAT {SL} ON A WEBSITE THIS WOULD PRODUCE UPSIDE DOWN U sp WHAT DOES EXAMPLE sp A B AND sp C LOOK sp LIKE {SL} sp sp {SL} AND X sp SYMBOLS STAND sp FOR {SL} sp I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE SAY sp EXAMPLE A IS GOING TO PRINT A TEXT THAT'S GONNA BE IN sp ARIAL sp FONT sp IT'S GONNA HAVE A PINK sp BACKGROUND sp UM {SL} COLOR AND sp THE UH COLOR OF THE ACTUAL TEXT IS GONNA BE RED sp FOR EXAMPLE B sp THEY'RE GOING TO ALIGN sp THE UH {SL} TEXT sp TEXT OF sp TEXT SLASH CSS sp IN THE CENTER AND IT'S GONNA BE BLUE sp THE sp THE ACTUAL GREAT sp THE U SYMBOL sp WORD TEXT sp AND FOR sp EXAMPLE C sp THE BACKGROUND COLOR FOR sp TEXT SLASH CSS sp WHEREVER THAT'S AROUND sp THEY'RE GONNA MEANS SURROUND THAT TOO THAT'S sp GONNA BE YELLOW {SL} RATHER THAN FROM sp BACKGROUND COLOR INITIALLY TO GREY AND sp THE COLOR sp OF sp THE THE COLOR OF THE TEXT sp UNION sp SLASH CSS sp TEXT FOR EXAMPLE C sp IS GONNA BE GREEN sp OK sp {SL} sp GREAT sp {SL} sp DESCRIBE SO A UNION TO ME USING THE PICTURE WHAT A LOOP IS {SL} sp THE sp ONLY LOOP I SEE HERE IS AT NODE FIVE AND WHAT A LOOP IS sp IS BASICALLY sp WHAT YOU WOULD THINK OF A LOOP IN B sp A REAL LIFE SITUATION sp {SL} sp FOR sp EVERY NODE IT'S GOING sp THERE IS sp IT IS EITHER DIRECTED OR UNDIRECTED sp IF IT'S DIRECTED TO THE SAME NODE IN THIS CASE sp I E IT IS POINTING sp TO THE SAME NODE AS IT sp AS IT sp IS AT IT'S CURRENT SPOT sp THEN IT'S sp A LOOP sp BECAUSE YOU'RE BASICALLY GOING AROUND AND YOU'RE GOING BACK TO WHERE YOU WHAT THIS MEANS ESSENTIALLY STARTED IN sp THAT SENSE sp OK sp HOW MANY LOOPS ARE THERE IN THIS PICTURE sp ONE sp OK {SL} AND WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THE ZERO VERTEX IS THAT sp UM sp UH {SL} sp INFORMAL TERM IS sp OUTLIER sp {SL} sp BUT {SL} sp I BELIEVE THE sp TECHNICAL TERM IS CALLED UM {SL} UNCONNECTED NODE {SL} UM {SL} YOU HAVE sp YES UNCONNECTED NODE sp AS FAR sp AS TO MY KNOWLEDGE sp OK {SL} DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION ALRIGHT sp SO THIS A SET sp A IS IS HERE {SL} sp I sp MEAN THIS IS EQUAL TO ONE STANDARD HTML I SUPPOSE AND WHAT THIS STANDARD HTML IS sp IS UH {SL} sp BASICALLY {SL} sp CREATING TWO AND sp YOU'VE GOT LIKE sp A LINE sp LIKE LINE BY LINE OR WORD FOR WORD RATHER sp DESCRIPTION FOR EACH sp WAFFLES sp AND sp WHAT THEY CONTAIN RESPECTIVELY SO sp ELEMENTS ONE TWO UH {SL} sp I MEAN {SL} IT'S PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHTFORWARD I MEAN ALL I CAN REALLY SAY IS THAT PERHAPS WITHIN THE TWO DESCRIPTION AND THREE sp LIKEWISE sp UH MODULES THAT MIGHT sp {SL} ACTUALLY NO sp I TAKE THAT BACK IT'S JUST GONNA BE ON {SL} ONE LINE WITH sp B BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NO WAY OF sp {SL} CREATING A NEW LINE WITH THIS CODE {SL} UH BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO UH {SL} sp YOU HAVE CREATE NEW MODULES FOR EACH sp FOOD CATEGORY WHICH sp IN THIS CASE sp {SL} sp A SET AND YOU'VE ACTUALLY NO I TAKE BACK WHAT I EARLIER SAID sp SORRY sp THAT'S GONNA BE UM sp ON A NEW LINE sp OK {SL} ALRIGHT sp AND WHAT TYPE OF CODING IS sp THIS {SL} GOT ELEMENTS FOUR sp IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LANGUAGE I'M GONNA GO SAY IT'S HTML sp SOME sp SOME sp SOME SORT OF MARKUP LANGUAGE SIMILAR TO HTML BUT {SL} FIVE SIX SEVEN NONETHELESS MOST LIKELY sp FROM MY KNOWLEDGE ANYWAYS sp WHICH IS sp {BR} sp I'LL BE HONEST NOT REALLY UP THERE BUT I'LL I'LL GO WITH GOOD FAITH AND SAY THAT THIS IS HTML
