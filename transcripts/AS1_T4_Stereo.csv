facilitator,SOME BASIC MATH AND
participant,IT'S NOT A sp IT'S NOT A TREE sp I I JUST sp I FORGET WHAT IT'S CALLED sp
facilitator,THAT'S ALRIGHT sp WHAT IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM SEVEN TO TWO sp
participant,UM sp ARE sp ARE THE LINES WEIGHTED sp ER WAIT NO sp THERE sp THERE ISN'T A PATH sp ER WAIT NO sp THE SHORTEST PATH IS UH EIGHT SIX TWO sp AND sp THE ONLY PATH REALLY sp UNLESS YOU GO EIGHT SIX SEVEN EIGHT SIX SEVEN HOWEVER MANY TIMES BACK TO sp TWO sp UH sp BUT YOU HAVE TO sp GO OVER SIX TO GET TO TWO sp SO sp EIGHT SIX TWO IS THE SHORTEST PATH sp
facilitator,OK sp GREAT sp WHAT IS A CYCLE sp ALSO CALLED A ROUTE OR A TOUR sp
participant,IF I RECALL A CYCLE sp SEE I DON'T REMEMBER HEARING ONE CALLED sp A TOUR BEFORE sp I KNOW WE'VE GONE OVER THIS KIND OF THING sp I I REMEMBER EULER CIRCUITS AND STUFF sp STUFF LIKE THAT sp BUT sp UM sp I DON'T KNOW I WAS AT FIRST I WANNA SAY IT'S A sp UH sp MEANDER THAT VISITS sp ALL OF THEM ONCE sp GOING TO GUESS sp OR IT COULD BE ONE THAT GOES THE sp SAME WAY sp THIS AROUND THE SAME THING sp
facilitator,PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS sp
participant,FLOORS sp BUT BUT I'M GONNA SAY ONE THAT UH VISITS ALL OF THEM ONCE ESPECIALLY CAUSE YOU SAID A TOUR sp AND THAT'S WHAT A TOUR MAKES ME THINK sp OF sp
facilitator,OK sp HOW MANY TOURS ARE IN THIS GRAPH sp
participant,UM sp UM sp WELL sp IF IT HAS TO PASS OVER ALL OF THEM ONCE sp THERE ARE NONE sp BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO sp BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS OVER ALL OF THEM ONCE sp UM sp IF sp IT DOESN'T sp BUT IT CAN'T LIKE JUST LOOP INFINITELY sp THEN THERE WOULD sp HAVE sp TO sp BE ONE CAUSE AS SOON AS YOU GET TO THREE YOU CAN ONLY GO TO NINE sp UM AND YOU CAN ONLY GET TO THREE sp FROM sp FIVE sp WHICH CAN ONLY BE REACHED BY FOUR sp WHICH CAN ONLY BE REACHED BY TWO sp BUT THE FACT AH sp AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO VISIT FOUR TWICE sp UM sp IS WHY I DO NOT sp THINK THAT IT IS THE UH sp I KNOW THE X WAS TIMES KIND THAT IS UH sp IF IT IS sp THE sp FACT THAT IT HAS TO sp GO TO ALL OF THEM ONCE THEN IT sp THEN IT HAS NONE sp BUT OTHERWISE IT HAS ONE sp
facilitator,OK
participant,sp
facilitator,sp ALRIGHT sp THIS IS A LIST OF SOME BIG O sp NOTATION FOR ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY sp
participant,BUT sp OH I'VE FORGOTTEN THIS sp BUT I'LL TRY sp
facilitator,OK sp SO GIVING NAMES AND EXAMPLES WHERE YOU CAN sp DESCRIBE TO ME THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPLEXITIES sp INSTEAD sp
participant,OK sp UH sp AH sp I sp CAN'T REMEMBER I KNOW O O OF ONE IS BASICALLY sp A sp CONSTANT SO IT MEANS THAT HOWEVER sp HOWEVER MANY UH sp TIMES IT sp ER HOWEVER IF sp MANY UH sp THINGS ARE BEING sp OH I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE PROPER sp TERMINOLOGY NOW sp HOWEVER MANY UH sp ARE BEING DONE IT WON'T CHANGE THE ONE OF THEM WAS INCLUSIVE UH COMPLEXITY sp UH sp I FORGOT THE sp EXPLANATION sp EXCLAMATION POINT WAS sp BUT FOR N IT MEANS THAT OR EXCLUSIVE THE sp UH sp THE COMPLEXITY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE NUMBER sp OF FACTORS IN IT sp FOR N SQUARED IT sp sp INCREASES sp EXPONENTIALLY SO sp UH IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLEX TO HAVE UH sp THREE THAN IT IS TO HAVE sp TWO FOR EXAMPLE sp UM sp FOR UM sp O LOG N IT'S sp THE OPPOSITE WHICH MEANS THAT sp IT sp CONTINUALLY GETS MORE COMPLEX sp BUT sp IT sp UM sp THE FACT THAT THE DOESN'T sp INCREASE sp IT IT sp INCREASES KIND OF LIKE sp {NS} {NS} sp UH THAT sp
facilitator,OK sp OK sp
participant,C IS THERE DOESN'T HELP
facilitator,AND WHICH TYPE OF COMPLEXITY IS BEST sp AND WHY sp
participant,UM sp WELL sp THE ONE I JUST GAVE sp UH sp EITHER sp {BR} sp O OF ONE sp OR sp O OF LOG N BECAUSE sp BOTH OF THOSE ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH sp UH VERY sp LARGE
facilitator,SO FOR THESE QUESTIONS
participant,NUMBERS OF FACTORS sp THIS IS OVERALL sp I MEAN sp IF YOU'RE NOT USING VERY MANY IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER QUITE AS MUCH sp IF YOU'RE NOT USING AS MANY UH sp AS I SAID I'M TERRIBLE AT TERMINOLOGY sp
facilitator,THAT'S OK sp
participant,BUT YEAH sp
facilitator,OK sp GREAT sp WHAT IS A VERTEX sp AND HOW MANY VERTICES* ARE* THERE* sp
participant,A VERT- UH -EX IF I RECALL IS ANYWHERE sp TWO LINES MEET sp SO THERE ARE sp ANY OF THE NUMBER OF POINTS IS A VERTEX SO THERE'S EIGHT sp VERTEXES sp
facilitator,OK sp WHAT IS AN sp EDGE sp AND HOW MANY EDGES ARE THERE sp
participant,AN EDGE IS A LINE BETWEEN TWO VERTEXES sp SO THERE'S ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE sp SIX SEVEN EIGHT sp NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE sp TWELVE EDGES sp
facilitator,OK sp HOW LONG IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM ONE TO SIX sp
participant,IN ORDER sp OR sp THE SHORTEST PATH FROM ONE TO SIX IS TWO EDGES AND IF YOU WANT TO USE THE sp TWO SHORTEST EDGES sp GO sp FIVE SIX sp
facilitator,OK sp
participant,HOWEVER THE EDGES DON'T APPEAR WEIGHTED SO sp
facilitator,OK sp AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT THREE AND TWO ARE ADJACENT sp
participant,THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS AN EDGE sp BETWEEN THEM sp
facilitator,OK sp GREAT sp THEN THAT'S IT sp UM FOR THIS sp SECTION sp SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO CALIBRATE THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES AGAIN SO IF YOU COULD JUST WATCH THE X'S sp ASSUME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ALRIGHT sp YOU ARE ALL DONE sp UM sp WE DO JUST WANNA HAVE YOU sp
participant,I'M sp NOT sp QUITE SURE sp
facilitator,IT'S sp OK
participant,TO
facilitator,sp
participant,BE HONEST sp
facilitator,IT'S OK sp WE ABOUT THESE MATHEMATICAL CAN SKIP IT sp WHAT IS THE ROOT NODE OF THIS GRAPH sp
participant,UM FIFTY sp
facilitator,THEORIES sp OK sp AND WHAT IS THE PARENT NODE OF NINETEEN sp
participant,UH TWENTY THREE sp
facilitator,OK sp WHAT ARE THE CHILD NODES OF SEVENTY TWO PLEASE EXPLAIN sp
participant,UH FIFTY FOUR AND SEVENTY SIX sp
facilitator,OK AND WHAT ARE THE SIBLING NODES OF TWELVE sp
participant,UH NINE AND FOURTEEN sp
facilitator,THE QUESTION AND ANSWER OK sp WHAT SPECIAL TYPE OF FUNCTION IT LIKE YOU'RE TUTORING ME IS sp THIS sp
participant,I DON'T KNOW sp THE
facilitator,sp
participant,OK F ER EXACT sp FUNCTION BUT IT USES UH sp AN IF STATEMENT sp UH LET'S sp SEE IF Y EQUALS ZERO RETURN X sp sp
facilitator,AND sp AGAIN
participant,I'VE I'M NOT SURE I'VE EVER SEEN THIS ONE YET ACTUALLY sp
facilitator,OK sp
participant,UM SO I'M
facilitator,IF YOU'RE NOT SURE THE ANSWER PLEASE
participant,NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT TYPE sp OF FUNCTION IT IS sp UH sp
facilitator,OK sp WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO sp TRY TO GUESS sp AND
participant,IF IT DOESN'T RETURN Y EQUALS ZERO sp IT CALLS ITSELF sp UNTIL UM sp {BR} sp
facilitator,IF YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY UNSURE
participant,{NS}
facilitator,OK JUST TELL ME THAT YOU WANT TO SKIP
participant,sp UH sp LET'S SEE sp
facilitator,THE QUESTION sp
participant,X sp MODULO Y sp SO IF Y DOESN'T EQUAL ZERO IT sp CALLS ITSELF AND IT CHANGES THE VARIABLES sp OK sp SO THAT sp UH sp WELL IT BASICALLY KEEPS GOING UNTIL IT sp UM sp Y
facilitator,GREAT
participant,EQUALS sp ER IT KEEPS DOING UH X MODULO Y UNTIL UH sp Y EQUALS ZERO BUT IT CHANGES sp THE PLACEMENT OF X AND Y EACH TIME sp
facilitator,I'M
participant,NOT
facilitator,sp
participant,GOOD WITH REMEMBERING SO I'M NOT sp QUITE POSITIVE sp ALTHOUGH I DO sp IT DOES sp CHANGE BOTH IT'S sp MEANT
facilitator,GOOD OK sp
participant,TERMINOLOGY TO UH sp CHANGE sp X sp BY A CERTAIN FACTOR sp UNTIL IT GETS TO A CERTAIN POINT sp
facilitator,OK sp GREAT sp WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT ONE
participant,{BR}
facilitator,sp
participant,sp BUT I AM OK WITH REMEMBERING
facilitator,WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO sp
participant,sp UH I'M sp SO sp I'M sp SO TERRIBLE AT REMEMBERING sp UH {NS} sp HOW sp STUFF WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS THIS EXACTLY sp
facilitator,I THINK IT'S PSEUDOCODE sp
participant,OH PSEUDOCODE OK sp UM sp WORKS sp I'VE sp I'VE NEVER SEEN A sp TO STATEMENT OR A DO STATEMENT sp
facilitator,OK SYNTAX
participant,UH sp A LIST sp {NS}
facilitator,sp OK sp {LS} THAT'S GREAT LIKE I SAID YOU
participant,OH IT ORDERS A LIST sp IT BASICALLY ORDERS THE
facilitator,KNOW JUST sp DO YOUR BEST TO GUESS
participant,sp UH sp IT ORDERS THE LIST FROM LEAST TO GREATEST sp ALTHOUGH I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT sp BUT
facilitator,EXCELLENT sp IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE ANSWER
participant,IT DOES AT THE VERY LEAST MOVE EVERYTHING CLOSER TO BEING sp FROM LEAST TO GREATEST sp
facilitator,OK sp AND WHAT'S THE FORMAL NAME FOR
participant,OH
facilitator,sp
participant,WAIT IT'S UNTIL
facilitator,IS AND sp
participant,sp UNTIL NOT sp SWAPPED SO sp IT IS sp UM sp IT IS UNTIL UH sp IT ORDERS sp ALL THE WAY THROUGH sp
facilitator,THERE'S OBVIOUSLY NO GRADING
participant,OK sp I DON'T sp QUITE REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE FUNCTION AS I SAID I'M TERRIBLE WITH NAMES FOR TERMINOLOGY sp
facilitator,SURE sp SURE THAT'S OK sp ALRIGHT sp GREAT sp sp EXPLAIN EACH OF THE SYMBOLS ON THE LEFT sp
participant,UM sp THE {LS} sp
facilitator,SO WE'RE JUST
participant,sp TURN A sp IS UH FOR EVERY sp UM sp THE E sp WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT sp
facilitator,GOING TO START OFF BY CALIBRATING
participant,FOR EVERY BLANK sp THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE sp UM sp THE BACKWARDS E MEANS sp EXISTS sp WHICH MEANS THAT sp THERE IS
facilitator,THE EYE TRACKER AGAIN
participant,A SITUATION WHERE sp THAT EXISTS sp I BELIEVE THE V WAS sp OR sp AND THE UPSIDE DOWN V WAS AND
facilitator,sp
participant,sp OR MEANS THAT sp UH sp IT IS sp ONE sp OR sp THAT IT sp IS sp ONE OR BOTH OF THEM IS TRUE sp UH CAUSE XOR IS SOMETHING ELSE sp AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT REPRESENTS sp THE UPSIDE DOWN V IS AND WHICH MEANS THAT sp BOTH CASES ARE TRUE sp AND THE ARROW MEANS IMPLIES WHICH MEANS THAT sp THEY ARE EITHER BOTH FALSE sp UM sp
facilitator,ALRIGHT
participant,I IF I REMEMBER IT'S EITHER BOTH FALSE sp ONE'S FALSE AND THE ONE ON THE OTHER END IS TRUE sp BUT IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT UM sp ONE sp AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ARROW IS TRUE AND THE OTHER ONE IS FALSE sp
facilitator,OK sp OK sp AND USING THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE RIGHT CREATE AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE sp AND YOU CAN DEFINE THE VARIABLES sp HOWEVER YOU WANT sp
participant,UH sp OH YOU MEAN FOR EACH OF THEM sp
facilitator,JUST FOR ONE sp
participant,UH sp GOD IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE DONE THIS sp UH sp FOR EVERY X sp UM sp FOR EVERY X UH C sp UH X AND sp FOR EVERY X C X AND U X sp UH sp ER WAIT I I FEEL LIKE X MEANT SOMETHING TOO sp OR AT LEAST THAT SPECIFIC sp KIND OF X sp BUT sp FOR EVERY UM sp FOR EVERY CASE sp C IS UH sp C IS THE SAME AS V WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR FALSE sp
facilitator,OK sp ALRIGHT sp THEN THE NEXT SESSION ON A WEBSITE THIS WOULD PRODUCE sp WHAT DOES EXAMPLE sp A B AND sp C LOOK LIKE sp
participant,UM sp WELL A WOULD BE sp UH sp EXAMPLE A IN BIG LETTERS AT THE TOP OF THE sp PAGE sp EXAMPLE B WOULD BE IN sp QUITE sp SOMEWHAT SMALLER LETTERS AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE sp AND EXAMPLE C WOULD BE sp IN UM MUCH LITTLER sp AH sp ER EXAMPLE B WOULD BE SLIGHTLY BELOW A sp AND THEN EXAMPLE C WOULD BE IN sp DECENTLY SMALLER LETTERS BELOW ALL THAT sp DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE REST OF IT DOES TOO OR sp
facilitator,UM sp NO JUST
participant,ER
facilitator,sp
participant,OH WAIT OH sp NO sp UH EXAMPLE ONE WOULD ALSO BE UH IN THE ARIAL FONT sp UM WITH sp A sp PINK BOX AROUND IT WITH sp UH THE FONT sp COLORED RED sp UM sp WHEREAS UM sp H TWO sp H TWO WOULD BE UH sp OH YEAH AND sp H ONE WOULD ALSO BE OVER TO THE LEFT H TWO WOULD BE CENTERED sp MEANING IT'S sp NEAR THE MIDDLE sp UH sp IN REGARDS TO LEFT AND RIGHT sp UM sp AND IT WOULD BE COLORED BLUE sp UH AND IT WOULD HAVE NO BACKGROUND COLOR I DON'T QUITE REMEMBER IF THAT WOULD MAKE THE BACKGROUND WHITE OR sp STILL PINK FROM sp THE HEADER ONE BUT IT DON'T sp THINK IT WOULD BE sp UH PINK I THINK IT WOULD BE WHITE sp UM AND THEN EXAMPLE C sp WOULD HAVE A
facilitator,IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT
participant,BOX AROUND IT COLORED YELLOW AND THE TEXT WOULD BE COLORED GREEN AND IT WOULD BE ON THE LEFT sp AND THE BACKGROUND ER WAIT NO THE BACKGROUND FOR sp H TWO WOULD BE GREY sp BECAUSE THAT'S HOW sp OH sp WELL NO I FORGET THE sp HEADER COUNT'S IN THE BODY I sp DON'T sp I'M NOT SURE MOST OF THE PAGE WOULD BE GREY I BELIEVE sp THE BACKGROUND FOR EXAMPLE B WOULD BE sp GREY sp
facilitator,OK sp GREAT sp DESCRIBE TO ME USING THE PICTURE WHAT A LOOP IS sp
participant,UM sp A LOOP IS WHEN sp A NUMBER CAN CALL sp IS WHEN ER NOT A NUMBER BUT I sp GUESS A NODE sp CAN CALL ITSELF sp SO IT CAN TRAVERSE sp RIGHT BACK TO ITSELF WITHOUT HAVING sp TO TRAVERSE TO ANOTHER ONE sp
facilitator,ON THE LEFT ARE EXPRESSIONS
participant,OK sp SO YOU CAN GO FROM ONE TO THREE sp FROM THREE TO THE DIFFERENT THREE sp FROM THREE TO THE FIVE AND THEN FROM FIVE sp BACK TO THE FIVE sp
facilitator,sp AND ON THE OK sp HOW MANY LOOPS ARE IN THIS PICTURE sp RIGHT ARE SETS sp
participant,ER WAIT NO sp THAT'S sp ACTUALLY sp OH THE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS OK sp
facilitator,SO
participant,UM sp SO I THINK I HAD THAT WRONG sp BUT sp
facilitator,WE JUST DID EXCEPT ON THE LEFT WHAT
participant,IN THAT SITUATION sp THERE ARE sp I WOULD SAY sp
facilitator,DO THE U UPSIDE
participant,ARE sp BY MY FIRST DEFINITION THERE'S sp ONE LOOP sp BUT sp BY ANOTHER DEFINITION IF I RECALL IT'S WHEN YOU CAN START AT ONE POINT sp
facilitator,DOWN U AND X
participant,AND THEN GO ALL THE WAY BACK AROUND sp TO IT WITHOUT sp PASSING OVER THE SAME ONE TWICE sp AND BY THAT DEFINITION sp UM sp
facilitator,sp SYMBOLS sp MEAN sp
participant,THERE WOULD BE ONE sp UH sp ONE TWO THREE sp LOOPS sp THERE'D BE THE THREE THE TWO AND THE FIVE THE THREE THE THREE AND THE FIVE AND THE TWO sp AND THE THREE THE THREE THE TWO THE FIVE AND THE TWO sp
facilitator,OK sp GREAT
participant,OH sp
facilitator,sp AND WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THE ZERO VERTEX sp
participant,UH sp AN ORPHAN sp I'M I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE sp PROPER sp TERMINOLOGY BUT THAT'S WHAT sp I'D sp UM sp CALL IT sp
facilitator,OK sp GREAT sp
participant,GOD IT FEELS LIKE IT'S BEEN AGES SINCE sp I'VE DONE SOME OF THIS STUFF sp
facilitator,THAT'S ALRIGHT
participant,I
facilitator,sp
participant,NEED A REFRESHER ON SOME OF THIS sp
facilitator,OK sp DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS HERE sp
participant,WELL sp THERE IS THE sp PRICE OF sp THE WAFFLES THE KINDS OF sp FOODS AVAILABLE sp THE UH sp THERE IS sp THE CALORIES sp FOR sp THE WAFFLES sp UM sp
facilitator,THIS TIME WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT
participant,AND THERE'S DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE TYPES OF WAFFLES sp
facilitator,OK sp WHAT KIND OF CODING IS THIS sp
participant,UM sp WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY WHAT KIND OF CODING LIKE THE NAME FOR THE sp FORMAT OR THE TYPE IT WOULD BE USED sp
facilitator,THE NAME FOR THE FORMAT sp
participant,UM sp I AM NOT sp HONESTLY SURE sp AS I SAID I'M TERRIBLE WITH sp TERMINOLOGY sp
facilitator,OK sp THAT'S OK sp WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF CODING INFORMATION THIS WAY sp
participant,UM sp {NS} sp I'M NOT SURE I'VE sp QUITE EXPERIENCED THIS TYPE BEFORE sp UH AH CRAP IT'S BEEN LIKE I MAY HAVE AND FORGOTTEN IT sp BUT sp UM ONE BENEFIT IS THAT sp ALL OF THE UH OVER A YEAR SINCE TYPES APPEAR TO HAVE THE SAME sp I GUESS YOU'D SAY VARIABLES sp SO IT IT APPEARS FAIRLY ORGANIZED sp MHM sp AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD I'VE sp DONE sp THIS sp PART BE FAIRLY EASY TO SORT RELATED FACTORS sp
facilitator,OK sp OK sp GREAT sp
participant,AND SEARCH YOU COULD SEARCH STUFF I sp SUPPOSE sp UM sp
facilitator,MHM sp OK sp WHAT KIND OF GRAPH IS THIS sp
participant,UM sp sp AH I FORGET WHAT THEY'RE CALLED sp UM sp
