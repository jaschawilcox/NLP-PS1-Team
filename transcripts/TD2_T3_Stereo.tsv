SEEMS LIKE THE BOY IS DEEP IN THOUGHT EITHER THAT I CAN'T TELL IF HE'S ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE DOG sp OR BUT MY FIRST sp MY sp MY FIRST THOUGHT IS THAT THE BOY IS DEEP IN THOUGHT JUST KIND OF STARING OFF INTO SPACE AND THE DOG IS IS UH sp IS KIND OF sp CURIOUS ABOUT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS sp WITH THIS BOY {SL} WHAT HAVE THE BOY AND DOG BEEN DOING BEFORE THIS sp MOMENT sp UM {SL} sp LOOKS LIKE THE BOY IS HOLDING SOMETHING IN HIS HAND MAYBE IT'S A UH {SL} sp LEASH sp OH WHICH MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT MAYBE sp HE'S EXPECTED TO BE sp FED AFTER THAT MAYBE sp SO MAYBE HE'S THE DOG'S ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE BOY BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT TO BE FED sp I COULD SEE THAT sp UM sp I sp I DON'T sp I DON'T I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER REASON WHY HE'D BE HOLDING sp A A UH ROPE sp SO I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A LEASH sp I THINK sp THEY PROBABLY JUST WENT FOR A WALK sp OR EITHER THAT OR THEY'RE ABOUT TO GO FOR A WALK AND THAT'S WHY THE DOG'S LOOKING AT THE BOY {SL} ALRIGHT sp HOW MUCH DOES THE DOG WEIGH {SL} sp UM {SL} MM sp THIRTY FORTY sp THIRTY OR FORTY POUNDS sp OK sp AND HOW OLD IS THE BOY sp UH HE LOOKS TO BE RIGHT AROUND UM sp STARTING OF ADOLESCENCE SO PROBABLY sp TWELVE OR THIRTEEN sp {SL} OK sp WHAT ARE THEY DROPPING OFF sp THE LEDGE sp UM IT sp SAYS CHIRP CHIRP sp UM OH BUT THAT'S JUST A BIRD OFF sp OFF TO THE SIDE sp CRACK sp UM sp {LS} sp LET'S SEE sp I DON'T KNOW IT LOOKS TO BE SOME sp CONTRAPTION WITH UM sp WITH A PARACHUTE TO SOMEHOW sp STOP sp UM sp TO SOMEHOW MAKE THE IMPACT sp UH sp NOT AS BAD sp UH TO sp TO SOFTEN THE IMPACT WHEN IT HITS THE GROUND sp UM {LS} sp WHAT THEY WHY THEY WOULD BE TRYING TO SOFTEN THE IMPACT I'M NOT SURE sp UM sp CRACK MAYBE MAKES ME THINK OF AN EGG SO MAYBE THEY'RE DOING SOME SORT OF COMPETITION WHERE THEY sp WHERE THEY sp MAKE sp CONTRAPTIONS TO THROW AN EGG sp OFF sp OFF A sp HIGH ALTITUDE AND TRY TO MAKE IT NOT sp UM sp BREAK {SL} sp OK sp HOW DO THE PEOPLE FEEL {SL} UM {SL} UM sp THE ONLY REALLY REAL INDICATION OF THEIR FEELINGS IS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING UP AT sp THE UH sp AT sp AT THE THE DROPPING sp THING WHATEVER IT MAY BE sp AND SO THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY APATHETIC TO IT UM sp THEY'RE sp EITHER sp YOU CAN TELL THEY HAVE sp THEY'RE SOMEWHAT INTERESTED IN WHAT'S GOING ON sp UM {SL} BUT OTHER THAN THAT sp UH YOU REALLY CAN'T TELL ANYTHING sp LIKE THEY HAVE sp BLANK FACES UM sp YOU CAN REALLY JUST TELL BY THEIR BODY sp UH sp STANCE sp LIKE THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT AND THAT'S ABOUT IT sp THEY sp THEY COULD BE KIND OF INTERESTED BUT NOT LIKE sp REALLY CARE THAT MUCH sp BUT BASICALLY THE ONLY THING YOU KNOW IS THAT THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY APATHETIC sp ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON sp OK sp WHY WOULD THE PEOPLE BE SURPRISED sp {SL} UM {SL} OH sp OH IT SEEMS LIKE A UH sp I GUESS THE BIRD sp I GUESS THE sp THE BIRD FLEW sp THROUGH THE sp THE APPARATUS sp UM sp AND CRACKED SOMETHING sp UM OR MAYBE HIT IT sp AND THEY WERE SURPRISED THAT THAT A BIRD sp HIT IT OK I GUESS sp THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE sp OK sp AND IS IT REALISTIC FOR AN EGG TO HATCH WHILE DROPPING sp OH OK sp UM {SL} NO BECAUSE IT'S A MUCH {LG} sp IT'S A MUCH SLOWER UM sp IT'S A MUCH SLOWER PROCESS THAN sp THAT IT LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE THAT GUY IS MAYBE sp WHAT TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FEET UP sp AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT A BIRD WOULD HAVE TIME TO HATCH ON THE WAY DOWN THE THE GUY UP THERE WOULD HAVE ALREADY NOTICED sp UM sp SO sp YEAH NO THAT'S COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC {SL} OK ALRIGHT {SL} WHY IS THERE MONEY ON THE TABLE sp UH BECAUSE THEY'RE GAMBLING sp OK sp WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE sp UM sp THE WOMEN ARE sp UH DRINKING AND GAMBLING AND sp PLAYING CARDS {SL} OK sp WHO KNOWS THAT THE MAN HAS CARDS BEHIND HIS BACK sp UM sp THE WOMAN sp IN THE CENTER sp UH RIGHT sp BECAUSE SHE'S POINTING AT HIM AND AND LOOKING AT HIM UH KINDA CURIOUSLY sp OR MAYBE IT'S ACTUALLY THE ONE sp UM sp TO THE IN THE THE CENTER LEFT sp BECAUSE sp MAYBE SHE JUST TOLD HER sp UM sp LIKE HE HAS CARDS BEHIND HIS BACK sp LIKE WATCH OUT HE'S CHEATING sp AND THEN AND THEN SHE'S POINTING AT AND THEN SHE'S POINTING AT HIM sp ASKING OH HIM sp UM sp SO EITHER OF THOSE TWO sp THE ONE ON THE RIGHT I sp DON'T THINK KNOWS {SL} ALRIGHT sp AND HOW RICH IS EACH PERSON IN THIS PICTURE {SL} UM {SL} sp JUDGING BY THE FACT sp THAT sp THAT THE WOMAN UM POINTING IS IN THE CENTER sp OF THE SHOT sp UM sp I WOULD THINK sp THAT SHE WOULD BE THE MOST WEALTHY sp UM sp AND SHE ALSO HAS A MORE UH sp FLASHY OUTFIT sp UM THAN THE TWO ON THE LEFT sp BUT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT ALSO HAS sp A PRETTY sp PRETTY FLASHY OUTFIT SO I COULD IMAGINE THAT sp THAT SHE sp COULD BE AS WEALTHY AS HER sp UM sp BUT THE ONE ON THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE REALLY DEFINITELY SEEMS MORE sp UH REGAL {SL} THAN THE THAN THE OTHERS {SL} OK ALRIGHT sp {SL} WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS sp PICTURE {SL} UM {SL} sp SO IT LOOKS AS IF UM SOMEONE IN THE MILITARY sp IS sp SHOWING {SL} THESE OTHER TWO PEOPLE {SL} sp SOME SORT OF DOCUMENT sp OR PICTURE sp UM {SL} sp IT'S IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE OTHER PICTURE I SAW sp UM {SL} BUT sp HE'S sp OH AND HE'S WEARING A STETHOSCOPE SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME SORT OF MEDICAL UNIT IN THE MILITARY UM sp MAYBE NOT AN M D sp UM sp BUT sp UM sp SOME SORT OF MEDICAL UNIT IN THE IN THE MILITARY sp UM sp AND IT LOOKS LIKE sp IT LOOKS LIKE THE TWO PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT ARE KIND OF EXCITED ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE SEEING sp UM {SL} IT'S IT'S NOT JUST IT'S IT sp LOOKS TO BE NOT JUST ONE RESULT BECAUSE THE OLD MAN IS UH sp POINTING sp AT SOMETHING SPECIFIC ON ON THE UH PICTURE sp AS IF TO sp UM {SL} TO NOTICE SOMETHING SPECIFIC IN IT sp UM {SL} AND UH sp THAT'S ABOUT IT OK {SL} sp WHAT IS THE PROFESSION OF THE MAN ON THE LEFT {SL} UM {SL} sp HE sp HE sp LOOKS TO BE SOME SORT sp OF MILITARY sp MEDICAL PERSONNEL sp UM sp BUT IT HE'S HE'S STILL WEARING HIS UNIFORM SO THE THAT I I QUESTION WHETHER UM sp WHETHER sp YOU KNOW FULL FULL ON FULL BLOWN UH DOCTORS sp WOULD sp WOULD STILL BE WEARING THEIR UH SHORT SLEEVED UNIFORM sp UM {SL} UH sp WHILE WHILE PRACTICING sp UM sp EVEN IF THEY ARE IN THE MILITARY sp UM SO MY GUESS IS HE'S HE'S SOME SOME LESSER FORM OF sp OF MEDICAL PERSONNEL IN IN THE MILITARY sp OK sp WHAT ARE THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS PICTURE sp I COULD SEE UM THE OLD MAN BEING sp UH THE FATHER sp OF sp OF THE UH WOMAN IN THE GREEN sp UM I THINK THAT'S MOST LIKELY TRUE sp UM {SL} AND sp {SL} AND THEN OBVIOUSLY sp UM {SL} sp OBVIOUSLY THE MILITARY UNIT IS SOME SOME TYPE OF UH sp SOME TYPE OF sp UH CARE PROVIDER FOR THESE TWO sp UH WHETHER sp WHETHER SHE'S IN THE MILITARY OR HE'S IN OR HE'S A VETERAN sp UM sp OR MAYBE STILL IN THE MILITARY I GUESS sp UM sp SO sp OK sp GREAT sp AND APPROXIMATELY HOW OLD IS EACH PERSON sp UM sp THE MAN ON THE LEFT SEEMS TO BE sp FORTY MAYBE MAYBE EARLY FORTIES sp UM sp LATE THIRTIES MAYBE sp UH sp THE WOMAN ON THE RIGHT SEEMS TO BE sp UH sp MAYBE sp THIRTY sp UM sp OR OR A LITTLE YOUNGER sp UM {SL} THE MAN SEEMS TO BE AROUND SIXTY FIVE {SL} SIXTY FIVE MAYBE MAYBE SEVENTY {SL} sp OK {SL} WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED sp {SL} UM sp {SL} WELL I CAN'T REMEMBER THE MOVIE VERY WELL sp BUT UH sp SOMETHING GOOD HAS OBVIOUSLY HAPPENED AS sp AS THEY ALL SEEM TO BE CELEBRATING UM sp AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE HOLDING WOODY UP sp INDICATES THAT HE'S sp HE'S THE ONE THAT THAT DID MOST OF THE UH sp HE'S THE ONE THAT THAT ACCOMPLISHED MOST OF OF OF THE UH sp OF THE THING THAT HAPPENED UH sp YOU KNOW HE'S THE HERO OF THE DAY THEY sp THEY'RE HOLDING HIM UP sp UM sp WHILE ALL OF THEM HAD SOMETHING TO GAIN sp UM sp FROM WHAT HAPPENED IT SEEMS AS IF HE'S HE UH sp HE'S THE HERO OF THE DAY sp {SL} sp OK sp HOW DO THE TOYS FEEL sp UM sp THEY'RE REALLY HAPPY UM ECSTATIC ALMOST {SL} OK sp HOW MANY FEMALE TOYS ARE IN THIS PICTURE sp UM sp THREE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL sp BUT sp UM sp YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY WAY OF KNOWING THE GENDER OF THE UH sp THE TWO sp THE TWO GREEN GUYS OR THE OR THE HER- sp THE HORSE REALLY {SL} OK sp AND WHAT ARE THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE TOYS sp UM {SL} WOODY IS THE COWBOY JESSIE IS THE IS UH THE FEMALE COWBOY sp UM sp I CAN'T REMEMBER sp WHAT BARBIE'S CALLED IN THERE MAYBE SHE'S JUST LITERALLY CALLED BARBIE sp UM sp UH WE HAVE MR POTATO HEAD sp AND UH MRS POTATO HEAD sp AND I sp THINK REX sp REX IS THE DINOSAUR {SL} UM AND THAT'S THOSE ARE ALL I OH UH sp SLINK sp MAYBE SLINKY sp I WANNA SAY IT'S JUST SLINK sp IS THE DOG {SL} OK ALRIGHT UM THEN THAT'S sp THE LAST QUESTION FOR THIS sp SECTION SO WE JUST NEED TO CALIBRATE THE EYE TRACKER GLASSES AGAIN sp OK sp UM sp SO JUST FOLLOW THE EXES sp PLEASE {SL} sp ALRIGHT sp SO AGAIN JUST LIKE BEFORE WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE A FIVE TO TEN MINUTE BREAK HERE {SL} sp
