participant,sp WE'LL GET sp STARTED HERE sp THIS TIME WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE AND WHAT WOULD CALL THE ZERO VERTEX {SL} UM sp THAT'S AN sp UH UNCONNECTED COMPONENT OF THE GRAPH {SL} UH sp sp OK {SL} UM DESCRIBE WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS HERE {SL} WHAT IS IT sp UM {SL} SO IT'S A MENU sp UM sp WITH EACH sp FOOD TAG sp THE sp I BELIEVE REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT ITEM ON THE MENU sp UM {SL} UH WHERE EACH sp EACH EACH ITEM ON THE MENU HAS A NAME sp UH A PRICE IT'S THE sp AND A DESCRIPTION sp UM sp SO sp IT'S INTERESTING THAT THIS IS KEPT IN sp IN TAGS BUT IT S- IT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY OBJECT ORIENTED sp UH I sp THINK sp UM WHERE EACH OBJECT IS IS IS AN ITEM OF FOOD sp UM IT sp ALSO KEEPS CALORIES I GUESS sp UM sp AND SO YOU CAN YOU COULD JUST KEEP sp KEEP MAKING ADDING IT'S CALLED THE DISECTION MORE UM sp FOOD TAGS sp UM sp EACH OF THE UH sp EACH OF THE THE sp UH NAME PRICE DESCRIPTION ALL I sp {LS} sp THOSE TAGS THAT ARE INSIDE THE FOOD TAGS YOU COULD SAY THAT THEY sp BELONG sp UM sp TO TO THAT TO THAT FOOD TAG sp UM {SL} CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY YEAH sp OK sp WHAT TYPE OF CODING IS THIS {SL} UM sp OBJECT- OBJECT ORIENTED sp CODING sp OK sp THE TERM sp UM AND WHAT IS A BENEFIT OF CODING INFORMATION THIS WAY sp UM {SL} IT HELPS TO UH {SL} SOME BASIC MATH sp AND sp BUT sp IT HELPS TO TO ACCESS UM {SL} SPECIFIC sp UM {SL} IT HELPS HELPS WITH SEPARATION BASICALLY IT'S OF INFORMATION BASICALLY sp UM sp CAUSE sp YOU HAVE YOU HAVE EACH FOOD OBJECT sp HAS sp HAS UM ALL OF THEIR ALL OF ITS INFORMATION UH ENCAPSULATED UH {SL} sp UM INSIDE OF IT sp UM {SL} {CG} {SL} YEAH sp IT'S OK sp ALRIGHT {SL} sp {NS} {SL} WHAT KIND OF GRAPH IS sp THIS sp UH THIS sp UH sp IS A UNWEIGHTED sp UH sp CONNECTED UM sp DIRECTED GRAPH {SL} sp OK sp WHAT ALL THE TERMS IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM sp SEVEN TO TWO sp {SL} LET'S SEE sp UM {SL} WELL sp THAT UM SEEING AS sp THE EDGES DON'T HAVE ANY WEIGHTS UM IT WOULD JUST BE THE SHORTEST AMOUNT OF sp EDGES I SUPPOSE UM {SL} AND SO IT WOULD JUST sp BE sp UM sp FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT TO SIX {SL} sp UH sp TO {SL} TWO sp YOU SAID sp TWO WAS THE FINAL ONE RIGHT YEAH THAT sp AREN'T OK sp YEAH
facilitator,OK
participant,sp THAT'S ACTUALLY sp IS THAT THE ONLY sp THAT MIGHT BE THE ONLY sp OH NOT IT'S NOT CAUSE YOU COULD ALSO DO CYCLES sp YEAH UH SEVEN EIGHT SIX THAT sp UH sp TWO {SL} sp OK {SL} WHAT IS A CYCLE ALSO CALLED A ROUTE OR A TOUR {SL} UM sp A CYCLE IN THIS CASE WOULD BE PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS INSTEAD A SERIES OF sp A SERIES OF sp UM sp NODES THAT WOULD GET YOU BACK TO THE SAME NODE sp AND SO SEVEN EIGHT SIX SEVEN sp UH WOULD BE A CYCLE IT'S UH {SL} YOU COULD JUST SINCE IT'S A sp UH sp DIRECTED GRAPH sp UM sp THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE CYCLES UM sp IN UNDIRECTED GRAPHS sp THERE'S THERE'S CYCLES EVERYWHERE JUST BECAUSE sp THEY'RE UNDIRECTED BUT HERE sp UM THERE'S A FEW CYCLES UM sp NOTABLY SIX SEVEN EIGHT sp UM sp CAUSE YOU COULD JUST KEEP sp UH GOING IN BETWEEN THOSE NODES AND YOU WOULDN'T EVER HAVE TO STOP {SL} OK sp AND HOW MANY CYCLES ARE IN THIS GRAPH {SL} sp UM {SL} LET'S SEE sp SEVEN EIGHT SIX sp SEVEN EIGHT SIX TWO FOUR SEVEN sp UM {CG} sp IT'S THE ELEMENTS {SL} HM {SL} {LS} sp UH THAT sp THAT {SL} sp THREE {SL} THREE OK {SL} sp AREN'T sp IN sp OK sp THIS IS A LIST OF SOME BIG O NOTATIONS FOR ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY sp SO GIVING NAMES AND EXAMPLES WHERE YOU CAN sp BOTH sp sp DESCRIBE TO ME THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EACH OF THE DIFFERENT COMPLEXITIES sp OK SO UM sp O OF ONE BASICALLY sp MEANS sp THAT sp B AND C UH sp THE THE NUMBER OF UM sp THE NUMBER OF sp INSTRUCTIONS OR UH {SL} COMMANDS THAT THAT NEED TO BE RUN sp MHM OK sp sp ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE AMOUNT OF ELEMENTS THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE USING SO SAY YOU sp HAVE A LIST OF sp OF UM sp N ELEMENTS sp UM UM sp OH WAIT AND YOU'RE TRYING sp TO DO SOME SOME OPERATION ON THAT LIST sp UM sp WHERE YOU NEED TO WHERE YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO EACH OF THOSE ELEMENTS sp UM OR THE LIST AS A WHOLE NO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S THAT'S sp UM sp O OF ONE WOULD WOULD TAKE UH sp SOME CONSTANT sp SOME CONSTANT NUMBER OF sp OF ITERATIONS OR UM {SL} sp THE INTERSECTION OR LIKE REPETITIONS OF THE SAME PROCESS sp UM {SL} WHEREAS UM sp O OF N sp WOULD WOULD TAKE SOME SOME PROPORTION UM AND SO IT'S UM sp OF sp OF REPETITIONS UM OF THE SAME PROCESS RELATIVE sp TO THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS N sp UH IN THAT IN THAT SET OF OF DATA THAT YOU'RE TRYING sp IT'S TO PERFORM THE ALGORITHM ON sp UM {SL} sp I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT UH sp WHAT sp N EXCLAMATION IS N FACTORIAL I GUESS sp sp ALL THE ELEMENTS SO FACTORIAL TIME WOULD BE sp HORRIBLE sp UM {SL} I DON'T EVEN KNOW OF ANY ALGORITHMS THAT WOULD BE THAT BAD sp IF IF IF IT ACTUALLY IS IF THAT'S ACTUALLY sp THAT ARE IN WHAT IT IS sp BASICALLY IT WOULD MEAN sp IF YOU HAVE N ELEMENTS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO sp PERFORM SOME ALGORITHM ON sp IT sp WOULD TAKE sp N FACTORIAL sp UH sp BOTH {SL} REPETITIONS OF THE SAME PROCESS IN ORDER TO FINISH IT sp UM {SL} YOU HAVE UM sp O OF LOG N IT'S THE SAME B AND C IDEA AS THE OTHER ONES UM {SL} IT'S UH THE AMOUNT OF THE UH sp THE UH sp COMPLEXITIES IS PROPORTIONAL TO sp THE SO FOR THESE QUESTIONS {SL} UH sp THE LOG OF sp THE LOG BASE TWO OF N sp UM {SL} sp AND THE SAME THING FOR UH O OF N SQUARED {SL} OK sp AND WHICH TYPE OF COMPLEXITY IS BEST sp AND WHY sp UH CONSTANT TIME IS IS THE BEST CONSTANT COMPLEXITY IS THE sp BEST IT'S THE FASTEST IT IT IT sp FINISHES IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME sp TAKING UP LESS LESS COMPUTER RESOURCES sp OK ALRIGHT {SL} SO FOR INSTANCE WHAT IS A VERTEX sp AND HOW MANY VERTICES ARE THERE sp UM sp A VERTEX IS IS BASICALLY EACH OF THOSE CIRCLES THAT YOU SEE B UPSIDE UM THAT ARE CONNECTED sp UM {SL} EACH OF THEM HAVING A NUMBER UM sp THERE'S sp ONE DOWN C ER TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT sp OF THEM sp OK sp AND WHAT IS AN EDGE AND HOW MANY EDGES ARE THERE AN sp EDGE IS UM sp ARE THE LINES sp B INTERSECT THAT CONNECT sp UH CONNECT THE VERTICES INDICATING YOU KNOW A CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO sp UH VERTICES sp UM sp AND SO {SL} C UM THERE WOULD BE ONE TWO THREE sp FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT sp NINE sp TEN sp ELEVEN EDGES {SL} sp ER WAIT DID I COUNT INCORRECTLY sp NO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S THERE'S TWELVE sp THERE'S TWELVE EDGES sp OK sp HOW LONG IS THE SHORTEST PATH sp FROM ONE TO sp SIX sp {SL} WOULD INCLUDE UM WELL SEEING AS IT'S UH sp SEEING AS IT'S AN UNDIRECTED GRAPH sp ER I MEAN A UH UNWEIGHTED GRAPH sp UM {SL} PLEASE ASSUME THAT I DON'T sp I MEAN sp UH UNLESS YOU WENT BY THE ACTUAL sp LENGTH OF THE EDGES WHICH IS PRETTY UNCOMMON sp UM sp IT IT COULD BE UM SIX EITHER ONE FIVE SIX OR ONE TWO SIX JUST BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S TWO EDGES SO sp YOU COULD CONSIDER EACH EACH EDGE WITH THE SAME WEIGHT sp UM I MEAN sp IF YOU SEVEN AND EIGHT IF YOU DID sp FOR SOME REASON CONSIDER sp UM AN EDGE sp THAT'S THAT'S PHYSICALLY LONGER LIKE IF THE LINE'S PHYSICALLY LONGER TO BE A GREATER WEIGHT THEN sp THEN IT {SL} WOULD BE ONE FIVE SIX sp BUT sp LIKE I SAID THAT'S sp THAT'S I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT SO sp OK {SL} sp ALRIGHT sp AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT sp THREE AND TWO ARE ADJACENT {SL} UM THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THREE AND TWO AS IN THERE'S THERE'S AN EDGE sp THAT GOES DIRECTLY BETWEEN sp THREE AND TWO {SL} sp OK sp ALRIGHT sp UM THEN THAT IS IT FOR THIS sp SECTION I'M JUST GONNA HAVE YOU UM WATCH THE EXES AGAIN SO THAT WE CAN CALIBRATE OK {SL} THE EYE TRACKER AND THEN YOU'LL BE JUST ABOUT FINISHED OK sp OK {SL} sp ALRIGHT sp sp ALRIGHT sp SO sp YOU ARE ALL DONE UM YOU CAN sp UM sp KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE MATHEMATICAL SO GIVEN THE SETS ON THE RIGHT sp WHAT sp SETS WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE LEFT sp {SL} OH WAIT COULD YOU REPEAT THAT sp YEAH sp YEAH sp SO GIVEN THE THEORIES sp MMK SETS sp THAT ARE ON THE RIGHT THERE sp WHAT sp SETS WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE LEFT sp {SL} sp OK sp UM {SL} sp SO PLEASE OK SO YOU MEAN sp OK SO sp A U B WOULD sp EXPLAIN THE QUESTION WOULD INCLUDE UH ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT sp MHM UM B INTERSECT C sp UM sp WOULD BE AND sp sp UH sp SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT sp UH A INTERSECT C sp WOULD BE sp UH THE EMPTY SET sp MEANING THERE'S NO ELEMENTS sp UM AND ANSWER IT LIKE IN THE SET sp OK sp UM {SL} I DON'T UH I DON'T HONESTLY REMEMBER UH sp WHAT THAT THE X YOU'RE TUTORING ME sp MMK sp THE X REPRESENTS sp UM {SL} sp FOR sp A SET OPERATION sp OK sp ALRIGHT {SL} NEXT sp UM AND AGAIN ONE {SL} sp WHAT IS THE ROOT NODE sp HERE {SL} sp UM sp FIFTY {SL} sp OK sp WHAT IS THE IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE ANSWER PARENT NODE OF NINETEEN sp UH TWENTY THREE {SL} sp OK sp WHAT ARE THE CHILD NODES OF sp SEVENTY TWO {SL} UM IS JUST TRY TO GUESS sp THE TWO CHILD NODES OF SEVENTY TWO ARE FIFTY FOUR AND SEVENTY SIX sp UM BUT sp DEPENDING ON sp LIKE sp KIND OF WHAT LEVEL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT COULD ALSO BE SIXTY sp AND IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY SEVEN COULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED A CHILD NODE OF SEVENTY TWO sp OK sp AND WHAT ARE THE SIBLING NODES OF TWELVE sp UM {SL} TWENTY NO IDEA WHAT THE ANSWER THREE {SL} sp I THINK JUST TWENTY THREE sp IS WHAT YOU'D CONSIDER sp A sp A SIBLING NODE JUST BECAUSE UH sp ITS DIRECT PARENT IS SEVENTEEN sp UM IS sp WE CAN SKIP THE sp BOTH OF BOTH OF THEIR PARENTS IS IS SEVENTEEN sp THEY'RE BOTH CHILDREN OF SEVENTEEN sp OK {SL} sp ALRIGHT {SL} QUESTION sp OK OK sp YEP sp WHAT sp SPECIAL TYPE OF FUNCTION IS sp THIS {SL} sp UM {SL} YEAH sp EXCELLENT sp THEN WE WHAT'S sp LIKE sp WHAT SPECIAL sp TYPE sp MHM {SL} UM {SL} I'M NOT REALLY sp I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY SPECIAL TYPE UM ARE GOING TO sp BUT IT'S sp IT'S sp A GREATEST sp COMMON DENOMINATOR FUNCTION THAT TAKES sp TWO INTEGERS AND sp UM sp RETURNS THE GREATEST OF sp COURSE CALIBRATE THE COMMON DENOMIN- DENOMINATOR OH IT'S A RECURSIVE FUNCTION BECAUSE sp AS YOU CAN SEE IT sp SAYS RETURN G C D UH Y X X MODULUS Y EYE TRACKER sp sp UM sp AND THAT'S A sp CALL TO THE SAME FUNCTION sp UM {SL} AND AND THAT'S KNOWN AS RECURSION sp UM AND SO sp YEAH sp OK sp SO THAT'S UM REAL QUICK HERE sp OK sp ALRIGHT sp AND WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} IT TAKES UH TWO INTEGERS AND sp RETURNS sp THE UH {SL} {SL} THE sp UH GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR OF THOSE TWO INTEGERS sp OK sp ALRIGHT {SL} WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} LET ME JUST LOOK AT IT FOR A SEC sp SURE {SL} sp IT SEEMS TO BE UM sp SORTING {SL} UM {SL} sp SORTING ELEMENTS IN A LIST sp UM sp A IS A LIST sp OF sp UH {SL} OF sp OF sp UH IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I GUESS OF ELEMENTS sp UM sp AND THEN {SL} AND THEN IF UH sp YOU YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A sp A UH A LOOP sp UM sp THAT sp REPLACES sp UM {SL} REPLACES ELEMENTS IN THE LIST IF sp IF sp THEY'RE IN THE WRONG ORDERING sp SO YOU SEE THAT sp IF sp IF A sp UH I MINUS ONE IS GREATER sp THAN sp A OF sp UH I {SL} THEN sp UH SWAP THE TWO ELEMENTS AS THEY'RE IN THE WRONG ORDER sp UM AND SO IT JUST GOES THROUGH AND sp AND sp UH GETS EVERYTHING IN TO sp IS THAT DESCENDING OR ASCENDING ORDER sp UM {SL} IT GETS EVERYTHING IN sp ASCENDING ORDER {SL} OK sp AND WHAT IS THE FORMAL NAME FOR THIS TYPE OF FUNCTION {SL} sp UM {SL} sp THE FORMAL NAME sp I MEAN IT'S IT'S A SORT sp UM {SL} sp I DON'T I DON'T sp KNOW THE THE FORMAL NAME sp OK I GUESS sp OK sp THAT'S sp ALRIGHT {SL} sp SO WE'RE GOOD sp COOL FIRST EXPLAIN EACH OF THE SYMBOLS ON THE LEFT sp UM THE UPSIDE DOWN A UH sp MEANS UH sp FOR ALL sp UM sp AND SO IF IF YOU WERE TO LOOK ON THE THE RIGHT SIDE sp UM sp YOU SEE sp UH THAT THE UPSIDE DOWN A AS WELL AS AN X RIGHT NEXT TO IT AND SO THAT MEANS sp FOR ALL X UM IT'S CALLED sp THE UNIVERSAL UH QUANTIFIER sp UM sp AND SO SO BASICALLY FOR UH THAT WOULD MEAN FOR ALL X sp UM AND THEN WHATEVER FOLLOWS sp IT MEANS THAT'S TRUE sp UM sp SO YOU SEE THAT THERE THERE'S AN EXPRESSION sp UM sp IN THAT THAT FUNCTION TO THE RIGHT WITH WITH WITH THE UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIER sp UM sp AND AND SO IF IF IT SAYS sp FOR ALL X AND THEN FOLLOWS IS AN EXPRESSION THEN THAT EXPRESSION IS TRUE FOR ALL X sp FOR ALL FOR ALL POSSIBLE VALUES OF X sp UM sp AND THEN YOU HAVE sp UH sp THE BACKWARDS E sp AND THAT'S CALLED THE UH EXISTENTIAL sp UH QUANTIFIER sp AND THAT MEANS THAT sp BASICALLY sp LIKE IT'S USED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIER BUT IT MEANS sp UH FOR SOME VALUE OF X LIKE THERE THERE EXISTS ONE sp AT LEAST ONE sp VALUE OF X sp SUCH THAT THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSION sp IS UH sp IS TRUE {SL} sp UM sp THE THE V IS UH OR sp UM sp AND SO THAT MEANS UM sp AN sp LIKE AN EXPRESSION WITH WITH OR BEING USED WOULD INDICATE {SL} sp ONLY THAT UH OK SO SO IF YOU LOOK IN IN THE UH IN THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN YOU SEE sp UM sp ONE OF THE EXPRESSIONS SAYS sp THEN C OF X UH sp OR sp U OF X sp UM sp SO IN ORDER FOR THAT WHOLE EXPRESSION TO BE TRUE sp UH sp ONLY ONE sp ONLY ONE OF sp ONE OF THOSE UH sp ONE OF THOSE UH TERMS IN THE EXPRESSION NEEDS TO BE TRUE sp SO EITHER C OF X NEEDS TO BE TRUE sp OR U OF X NEEDS TO BE TRUE AND THEN THE WHOLE EXPRESSION WOULD BE TRUE sp UM IN CONTRAST THE UH sp UPSIDE DOWN V IS AN AND SYMBOL sp AND SO THAT MEANS {SL} sp UM sp {CG} IN ORDER FOR AN EXPRESSION TO BE TRUE sp UH sp ASSUMING THERE'S TWO sp THERE'S TWO sp THERE'S TWO TERMS IN THE EXPRESSION sp SO JUST LIKE THERE IS IN THE RIGHT COLUMN sp UM WITH WITH R OF X AND L OF X sp UM {SL} ON- UH sp BOTH OF THEM NEED sp OK sp ON TO BE TRUE FOR THE WHOLE EXPRESSION TO BE TRUE sp UM sp AND THEN THE ARROW sp UH sp IS sp MEANS IMPLIES sp UM THE LEFT ARE EXPRESSIONS AND SO THAT MEANS BASICALLY sp IF UM {SL} IF sp IF THE THE TERM BEFORE THAT SYMBOL IS TRUE sp THEN sp THE sp AND ON THE RIGHT UH sp SYMBOL AFTER IT IS TRUE sp SO sp IN THE IN THE EXPRESSION IN THE RIGHT UH IN THE RIGHT COLUMN L OF X IMPLIES P OF X sp UM {SL} ARE SETS sp MHM sp THAT MEANS sp IF L OF X IS TRUE sp UM sp AND P OF X IS TRUE sp THEN IT WOULD RETURN TRUE sp SO ON THE LEFT sp ER I MEAN THEN THE WHOLE EXPRESSION WOULD BE TRUE sp HOWEVER UM sp IF L OF X IS sp UH {SL} IF L OF X THE NEXT SECTION sp WHAT DO THE U IS TRUE AND P OF X IS FALSE THEN THEN THE WHOLE EXPRESSION WOULD RETURN FALSE sp UM sp SO BASICALLY {SL} BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IS IT MEANS UPSIDE DOWN U IF IF THE FIRST EXPRESSION IS FALSE THEN sp UM sp ER IF THE FIRST EXPRESSION IS TRUE THEN THE OTHER ONE HAS TO BE TRUE sp BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS ON THE TABLE AND X sp SYMBOLS IT sp CAN BE ANYTHING ELSE sp {SL} sp OK sp ALRIGHT sp AND THEN USING THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE RIGHT sp CREATE AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE sp SO YOU CAN DEFINE THE VARIABLES MEAN sp HOWEVER YOU WANT {SL} OK ALRIGHT UM {SL} sp OK SO LET'S SEE {SL} THE U UH UM LET'S SAY {SL} UH sp C OF X sp IS UM {SL} sp LET'S SAY C OF X MEANS THAT sp UH {SL} MEANS UNION AND SOMEONE IS {SL} sp IS UH sp THAT C OF OK SO LET'S SAY X X IS UH sp ALL sp X IS UH SO sp THAT A PERSON IN THE UNIVERSE sp UM sp LIKE A HUMAN BEING sp UH C OF X sp IMPLIES THAT SOMEONE sp IS BELOW THE AGE OF FIFTY sp IS sp UM {SL} U OF X IMPLIES sp THAT sp SOMEONE IS EITHER sp FIFTY OR sp OR UM sp THE ABOVE sp THAT AGE sp UM sp AND SO THEN sp FOR ALL sp PEOPLE sp IN THE UNIVERSE sp UM {SL} COMBINATION sp FOR sp YEAH FOR ALL sp FOR EVERY PERSON IN THE UNIVERSE THAT PERSON IS EITHER sp BELOW FIFTY YEARS OLD sp OR sp GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO FIFTY YEARS OLD {SL} sp IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT OF UH OK sp ALRIGHT {SL} sp SO ON A WEBSITE THAT THIS sp WOULD PRODUCE sp WHAT DOES EXAMPLE THOSE TWO SETS INVOLVED A B AND sp C LOOK LIKE {SL} EXAMPLE A B AND C sp MHM SO A {SL} sp OH sp OH OK sp UM sp THOSE ARE UH WELL sp EXAMPLE A sp IS A U B sp UH sp IS A HEADER sp UM AND SO THE TEXT WOULD BE A LITTLE sp BIT BIGGER sp UM sp IT WOULD BE IT sp WOULD STAND OUT MORE sp UM sp TO THE EYE UM sp AND WOULD GROUP sp WOULD GROUP OTHER UH {SL} OTHER UH sp OTHER sp OTHER UH TAGS sp UM sp AND THEN WOULD MEAN A SINGLE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE FORMATTING IS IS CHANGED UP IN THE UH FIRST SECTION sp SO H ONE UH sp IT'S ARIAL sp UM sp IT'S PINK SET sp ER sp THE BACKGROUND COLOR'S PINK AND THE ACTUAL COLOR OF THE TEXT IS RED sp FOR H TWO IT'S THE SAME THING IT'S A HEADING sp UM sp UH WE sp WE SEE THAT THAT INCLUDING EVERY THE TEXT ALIGN IS CHANGED TO UM sp CENTER sp RATHER THAN sp LEFT sp LEFT ALIGN WHICH IT IS UH BY DEFAULT sp UM AND sp THEN ELEMENT IN THE COLOR IS BLUE {SL} AND THE BACKGROUND COLOR WOULD STILL BE WHITE WHICH IS THE DEFAULT {SL} sp UM {SL} sp AND THEN EXAMPLE C BOTH sp OF sp UM sp IT'S IN A sp IT'S IN A UH PARAGRAPH UM TAG {SL} UM AND sp AND THE STYLE THAT WE'VE sp SET UP sp UH THE C WE JUST sp DID EXCEPT sp THE SETS A AND S S STYLE WE'VE SET UP FOR PARAGRAPHS UP IN THE FIRST SECTION sp UM {SL} IS THAT THE BACKGROUND COLOR IS YELLOW sp AND THEN THE COLOR OF THE TEXT IS GREEN sp B sp UM sp AND THE PARAGRAPH TEXT SHOULD sp SHOULD BE sp UM OF A SMALLER FONT THAN THE TWO HEADINGS EXAMPLE A AND B {SL} UM OK {SL} UM sp DESCRIBE TO ME {SL} USING THE PICTURE WHAT A LOOP IS {SL} WHAT A LOOP sp IS sp UM sp A LOOP sp IN PROGRAMMING sp OR {SL} sp AND IN THIS PICTURE sp OK sp UM sp WELL IT WOULD JUST MEAN YOU'D BE ABLE TO sp GET FROM ONE NODE sp UH sp BACK TO THE THE UH UPSIDE SAME NODE USING USING A LOOP UM sp OR sp YEAH WITHOUT WITHOUT ANY OTHER UM sp WITHOUT ANY OTHER INTERMEDIARY NODES UM sp DOWN U IS AND SO sp LIKE SO SO THIS IS A GRAPH IT'S MADE OUT OF NODES AND EDGES UM sp THERE'S ONE LOOP sp ON THIS ON THIS GRAPH sp BECAUSE sp YOU SEE THAT UH sp UM sp YOU CAN GET FROM FROM FIVE BACK TO FIVE sp WITHOUT ANY INTERMEDIARY sp UH NODES sp UM sp YOU COULD GET FROM {SL} sp THE THE UH UH GET sp FROM ONE sp BACK TO ONE sp UH sp IF YOU WANTED BUT YOU'D HAVE TO GO TO sp GO TO THREE FIRST AND THEN BACK TO ONE sp UM sp AND SO THAT {SL} WOULD BE A LOOP {SL} OK sp HOW MANY LOOPS ARE THERE IN THIS PICTURE {SL} UM sp ONE sp OK sp
