0.927891156462 - 1.04761904762	participant GET sp STARTED HERE sp YEAH sp WE'RE GOOD sp COOL sp THEN THE NEXT SECTION IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE JUST sp DID EXCEPT THIS TIME WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT SOME BASIC MATH sp AND PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS INSTEAD sp MHM OK sp SO FOR THESE QUESTIONS PLEASE ASSUME THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE MATHEMATICAL THEORIES sp MMK sp SO PLEASE sp EXPLAIN THE QUESTION AND sp AND ANSWER IT LIKE YOU'RE TUTORING ME sp MMK sp UM AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE ANSWER IS JUST TRY TO GUESS sp AND IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT THE ANSWER IS sp WE CAN SKIP THE QUESTION sp OK OK sp YEP sp EXCELLENT sp THEN WE ARE GOING TO OF sp COURSE CALIBRATE THE EYE TRACKER sp UM REAL QUICK HERE {SL} sp OK sp ON THE LEFT ARE EXPRESSIONS sp AND ON THE RIGHT ARE SETS sp MHM sp SO ON THE LEFT sp WHAT DO THE U UPSIDE DOWN U AND X sp SYMBOLS MEAN sp THE U UH MEANS UNION AND SO sp THAT sp IS UM sp THE COMBINATION OF UH THOSE TWO SETS INVOLVED SO A U B sp UM sp WOULD MEAN A SINGLE SET sp INCLUDING EVERY ELEMENT IN BOTH sp OF sp THE SETS A AND B sp UM {SL} sp AND THE UH UPSIDE DOWN U IS UM sp THE UH {SL} THE UH sp WHAT IS IT sp THE sp I BELIEVE IT'S THE UH I sp THINK sp IT'S CALLED THE DISECTION I sp {LS} sp CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY THE TERM sp UM sp BUT BASICALLY IT'S UH {SL} IT'S sp UH sp ALL THE TERMS sp THAT UM sp THAT sp AREN'T THAT sp UH sp IT'S UH {SL} {CG} sp IT'S THE ELEMENTS THAT sp THAT sp AREN'T sp IN sp BOTH sp B AND C sp UM sp OH WAIT NO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S THAT'S THE INTERSECTION UM AND SO IT'S sp IT'S sp ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE IN sp BOTH B AND C {SL} SO FOR INSTANCE B UPSIDE DOWN C ER sp B INTERSECT C UM sp WOULD INCLUDE sp UM SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT {SL} OK {SL} sp ALRIGHT sp UM sp SO GIVEN THE SETS ON THE RIGHT sp WHAT sp SETS WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE LEFT sp {SL} OH WAIT COULD YOU REPEAT THAT sp YEAH sp YEAH sp SO GIVEN THE SETS sp THAT ARE ON THE RIGHT THERE sp WHAT sp SETS WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE LEFT sp {SL} sp OK sp UM {SL} OK SO YOU MEAN sp OK SO sp A U B WOULD WOULD INCLUDE UH ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT sp MHM UM B INTERSECT C sp UM sp WOULD BE sp UH sp SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT sp UH A INTERSECT C sp WOULD BE sp UH THE EMPTY SET sp MEANING THERE'S NO ELEMENTS sp UM IN THE SET sp OK sp UM {SL} I DON'T UH I DON'T HONESTLY REMEMBER UH sp WHAT THAT THE X sp THE X REPRESENTS sp UM {SL} sp FOR sp A SET OPERATION sp OK sp ALRIGHT {SL} NEXT ONE {SL} sp WHAT IS THE ROOT NODE sp HERE {SL} sp UM sp FIFTY {SL} sp OK sp WHAT IS THE PARENT NODE OF NINETEEN sp UH TWENTY THREE {SL} sp OK sp WHAT ARE THE CHILD NODES OF sp SEVENTY TWO {SL} UM sp THE TWO CHILD NODES OF SEVENTY TWO ARE FIFTY FOUR AND SEVENTY SIX sp UM BUT sp DEPENDING ON sp LIKE sp KIND OF WHAT LEVEL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT COULD ALSO BE SIXTY SEVEN COULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED A CHILD NODE OF SEVENTY TWO sp OK sp AND WHAT ARE THE SIBLING NODES OF TWELVE sp UM {SL} TWENTY THREE {SL} sp I THINK JUST TWENTY THREE sp IS WHAT YOU'D CONSIDER sp A sp A SIBLING NODE JUST BECAUSE UH sp ITS DIRECT PARENT IS SEVENTEEN sp UM sp BOTH OF BOTH OF THEIR PARENTS IS IS SEVENTEEN sp THEY'RE BOTH CHILDREN OF SEVENTEEN sp OK {SL} sp ALRIGHT {SL} WHAT sp SPECIAL TYPE OF FUNCTION IS sp THIS {SL} sp UM {SL} WHAT'S sp LIKE sp WHAT SPECIAL sp TYPE sp MHM {SL} UM {SL} I'M NOT REALLY sp I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY SPECIAL TYPE UM sp BUT IT'S sp IT'S sp A GREATEST sp COMMON DENOMINATOR FUNCTION THAT TAKES sp TWO INTEGERS AND sp UM sp RETURNS THE GREATEST COMMON DENOMIN- DENOMINATOR OH IT'S A RECURSIVE FUNCTION BECAUSE sp AS YOU CAN SEE IT sp SAYS RETURN G C D UH Y X X MODULUS Y sp UM sp AND THAT'S A sp CALL TO THE SAME FUNCTION sp UM {SL} AND AND THAT'S KNOWN AS RECURSION sp UM AND SO sp YEAH sp OK sp SO THAT'S sp OK sp ALRIGHT sp AND WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} IT TAKES UH TWO INTEGERS AND sp RETURNS sp THE UH {SL} THE sp UH GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR OF THOSE TWO INTEGERS sp OK sp ALRIGHT {SL} WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} LET ME JUST LOOK AT IT FOR A SEC sp SURE {SL} sp IT SEEMS TO BE UM sp SORTING {SL} UM {SL} sp SORTING ELEMENTS IN A LIST sp UM sp A IS A LIST sp OF sp UH {SL} OF sp OF sp UH IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I GUESS OF ELEMENTS sp UM sp AND THEN {SL} AND THEN IF UH sp YOU YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A sp A UH A LOOP sp UM sp THAT sp REPLACES sp UM {SL} REPLACES ELEMENTS IN THE LIST IF sp IF sp THEY'RE IN THE WRONG ORDERING sp SO YOU SEE THAT sp IF sp IF A sp UH I MINUS ONE IS GREATER sp THAN sp A OF sp UH I {SL} THEN sp UH SWAP THE TWO ELEMENTS AS THEY'RE IN THE WRONG ORDER sp UM AND SO IT JUST GOES THROUGH AND sp AND sp UH GETS EVERYTHING IN TO sp IS THAT DESCENDING OR ASCENDING ORDER sp UM {SL} IT GETS EVERYTHING IN sp ASCENDING ORDER {SL} OK sp AND WHAT IS THE FORMAL NAME FOR THIS TYPE OF FUNCTION {SL} sp UM {SL} sp THE FORMAL NAME sp I MEAN IT'S IT'S A SORT sp UM {SL} sp I DON'T I DON'T sp KNOW THE THE FORMAL NAME sp OK I GUESS sp OK sp THAT'S sp ALRIGHT {SL} sp SO FIRST EXPLAIN EACH OF THE SYMBOLS ON THE LEFT sp UM THE UPSIDE DOWN A UH sp MEANS UH sp FOR ALL sp UM sp AND SO IF IF YOU WERE TO LOOK ON THE THE RIGHT SIDE sp UM sp YOU SEE sp UH THAT THE UPSIDE DOWN A AS WELL AS AN X RIGHT NEXT TO IT AND SO THAT MEANS sp FOR ALL X UM IT'S CALLED sp THE UNIVERSAL UH QUANTIFIER sp UM sp AND SO SO BASICALLY FOR UH THAT WOULD MEAN FOR ALL X sp UM AND THEN WHATEVER FOLLOWS sp IT MEANS THAT'S TRUE sp UM sp SO YOU SEE THAT THERE THERE'S AN EXPRESSION sp UM sp IN THAT THAT FUNCTION TO THE RIGHT WITH WITH WITH THE UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIER sp UM sp AND AND SO IF IF IT SAYS sp FOR ALL X AND THEN FOLLOWS IS AN EXPRESSION THEN THAT EXPRESSION IS TRUE FOR ALL X sp FOR ALL FOR ALL POSSIBLE VALUES OF X sp UM sp AND THEN YOU HAVE sp UH sp THE BACKWARDS E sp AND THAT'S CALLED THE UH EXISTENTIAL sp UH QUANTIFIER sp AND THAT MEANS THAT sp BASICALLY sp LIKE IT'S USED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIER BUT IT MEANS sp UH FOR SOME VALUE OF X LIKE THERE THERE EXISTS ONE sp AT LEAST ONE sp VALUE OF X sp SUCH THAT THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSION sp IS UH sp IS TRUE {SL} sp UM sp THE THE V IS UH OR sp UM sp AND SO THAT MEANS UM sp AN sp LIKE AN EXPRESSION WITH WITH OR BEING USED WOULD INDICATE {SL} sp ONLY THAT UH OK SO SO IF YOU LOOK IN IN THE UH IN THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN YOU SEE sp UM sp ONE OF THE EXPRESSIONS SAYS C OF X UH sp OR sp U OF X sp UM sp SO IN ORDER FOR THAT WHOLE EXPRESSION TO BE TRUE sp UH sp ONLY ONE sp ONLY ONE OF sp ONE OF THOSE UH sp ONE OF THOSE UH TERMS IN THE EXPRESSION NEEDS TO BE TRUE sp SO EITHER C OF X NEEDS TO BE TRUE sp OR U OF X NEEDS TO BE TRUE AND THEN THE WHOLE EXPRESSION WOULD BE TRUE sp UM IN CONTRAST THE UH sp UPSIDE DOWN V IS AN AND SYMBOL sp AND SO THAT MEANS {SL} sp UM sp {CG} IN ORDER FOR AN EXPRESSION TO BE TRUE sp UH sp ASSUMING THERE'S TWO sp THERE'S TWO sp THERE'S TWO TERMS IN THE EXPRESSION sp SO JUST LIKE THERE IS IN THE RIGHT COLUMN sp UM WITH WITH R OF X AND L OF X sp UM {SL} ON- UH sp BOTH OF THEM NEED TO BE TRUE FOR THE WHOLE EXPRESSION TO BE TRUE sp UM sp AND THEN THE ARROW sp UH sp IS sp MEANS IMPLIES sp UM AND SO THAT MEANS BASICALLY sp IF UM {SL} IF sp IF THE THE TERM BEFORE THAT SYMBOL IS TRUE sp THEN sp THE UH sp SYMBOL AFTER IT IS TRUE sp SO sp IN THE IN THE EXPRESSION IN THE RIGHT UH IN THE RIGHT COLUMN L OF X IMPLIES P OF X sp UM {SL} sp THAT MEANS sp IF L OF X IS TRUE sp UM sp AND P OF X IS TRUE sp THEN IT WOULD RETURN TRUE sp ER I MEAN THEN THE WHOLE EXPRESSION WOULD BE TRUE sp HOWEVER UM sp IF L OF X IS sp UH {SL} IF L OF X IS TRUE AND P OF X IS FALSE THEN THEN THE WHOLE EXPRESSION WOULD RETURN FALSE sp UM sp SO BASICALLY {SL} BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IS IT MEANS IF IF THE FIRST EXPRESSION IS FALSE THEN sp UM sp ER IF THE FIRST EXPRESSION IS TRUE THEN THE OTHER ONE HAS TO BE TRUE sp BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS ON THE TABLE IT sp CAN BE ANYTHING ELSE sp {SL} sp OK sp ALRIGHT sp AND THEN USING THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE RIGHT sp CREATE AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE sp SO YOU CAN DEFINE THE VARIABLES HOWEVER YOU WANT {SL} OK ALRIGHT UM {SL} sp OK SO LET'S SEE {SL} UM LET'S SAY {SL} UH sp C OF X sp IS UM {SL} sp LET'S SAY C OF X MEANS THAT sp UH {SL} SOMEONE IS {SL} sp IS UH sp THAT C OF OK SO LET'S SAY X X IS UH sp ALL sp X IS UH A PERSON IN THE UNIVERSE sp UM sp LIKE A HUMAN BEING sp UH C OF X sp IMPLIES THAT SOMEONE sp IS BELOW THE AGE OF FIFTY sp UM {SL} U OF X IMPLIES sp THAT sp SOMEONE IS EITHER sp FIFTY OR sp OR ABOVE sp THAT AGE sp UM sp AND SO THEN sp FOR ALL sp PEOPLE sp IN THE UNIVERSE sp UM {SL} sp FOR sp YEAH FOR ALL sp FOR EVERY PERSON IN THE UNIVERSE THAT PERSON IS EITHER sp BELOW FIFTY YEARS OLD sp OR sp GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO FIFTY YEARS OLD {SL} sp OK sp ALRIGHT {SL} sp SO ON A WEBSITE THAT THIS sp WOULD PRODUCE sp WHAT DOES EXAMPLE A B AND sp C LOOK LIKE {SL} EXAMPLE A B AND C sp MHM {SL} sp OH sp OH OK sp UM sp THOSE ARE UH WELL sp EXAMPLE A sp IS A UH sp IS A HEADER sp UM AND SO THE TEXT WOULD BE A LITTLE sp BIT BIGGER sp UM sp IT WOULD BE IT sp WOULD STAND OUT MORE sp UM sp TO THE EYE AND WOULD GROUP sp WOULD GROUP OTHER UH {SL} OTHER UH sp OTHER sp OTHER UH TAGS sp UM sp AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE FORMATTING IS IS CHANGED UP IN THE UH FIRST SECTION sp SO H ONE UH sp IT'S ARIAL sp UM sp IT'S PINK ER sp THE BACKGROUND COLOR'S PINK AND THE ACTUAL COLOR OF THE TEXT IS RED sp FOR H TWO IT'S THE SAME THING IT'S A HEADING sp UM sp UH WE sp WE SEE THAT THAT THE TEXT ALIGN IS CHANGED TO UM sp CENTER sp RATHER THAN sp LEFT sp LEFT ALIGN WHICH IT IS UH BY DEFAULT sp UM AND sp THEN THE COLOR IS BLUE {SL} AND THE BACKGROUND COLOR WOULD STILL BE WHITE WHICH IS THE DEFAULT {SL} sp UM {SL} sp AND THEN EXAMPLE C sp UM sp IT'S IN A sp IT'S IN A UH PARAGRAPH UM TAG {SL} UM AND sp AND THE STYLE THAT WE'VE sp SET UP sp UH THE C S S STYLE WE'VE SET UP FOR PARAGRAPHS UP IN THE FIRST SECTION sp UM {SL} IS THAT THE BACKGROUND COLOR IS YELLOW sp AND THEN THE COLOR OF THE TEXT IS GREEN sp UM sp AND THE PARAGRAPH TEXT SHOULD sp SHOULD BE sp UM OF A SMALLER FONT THAN THE TWO HEADINGS EXAMPLE A AND B {SL} OK {SL} UM sp DESCRIBE TO ME USING THE PICTURE WHAT A LOOP IS {SL} WHAT A LOOP sp IS sp UM sp A LOOP sp IN PROGRAMMING sp OR {SL} IN THIS PICTURE sp OK sp UM sp WELL IT WOULD JUST MEAN YOU'D BE ABLE TO sp GET FROM ONE NODE sp UH sp BACK TO THE SAME NODE USING USING A LOOP UM sp OR sp YEAH WITHOUT WITHOUT ANY OTHER UM sp WITHOUT ANY OTHER INTERMEDIARY NODES UM sp AND SO sp LIKE SO SO THIS IS A GRAPH IT'S MADE OUT OF NODES AND EDGES UM sp THERE'S ONE LOOP sp ON THIS ON THIS GRAPH sp BECAUSE sp YOU SEE THAT UH sp YOU CAN GET FROM FROM FIVE BACK TO FIVE sp WITHOUT ANY INTERMEDIARY sp UH NODES sp UM sp YOU COULD GET FROM {SL} sp THE UH GET sp FROM ONE sp BACK TO ONE sp UH sp IF YOU WANTED BUT YOU'D HAVE TO GO TO sp GO TO THREE FIRST AND THEN BACK TO ONE sp UM sp AND SO THAT WOULD BE A LOOP {SL} OK sp HOW MANY LOOPS ARE THERE IN THIS PICTURE {SL} UM sp ONE sp OK sp AND WHAT WOULD CALL THE ZERO VERTEX {SL} UM sp THAT'S AN sp UH UNCONNECTED COMPONENT OF THE GRAPH {SL} sp OK {SL} UM DESCRIBE WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS HERE {SL} UM {SL} SO IT'S A MENU sp UM sp WITH EACH sp FOOD TAG sp REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT ITEM ON THE MENU sp UM {SL} UH WHERE EACH sp EACH EACH ITEM ON THE MENU HAS A NAME sp UH A PRICE sp AND A DESCRIPTION sp UM sp SO sp IT'S INTERESTING THAT THIS IS KEPT IN sp IN TAGS BUT IT S- IT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY OBJECT ORIENTED sp UM WHERE EACH OBJECT IS IS IS AN ITEM OF FOOD sp UM IT sp ALSO KEEPS CALORIES I GUESS sp UM sp AND SO YOU CAN YOU COULD JUST KEEP sp KEEP MAKING ADDING MORE UM sp FOOD TAGS sp UM sp EACH OF THE UH sp EACH OF THE THE sp UH NAME PRICE DESCRIPTION ALL THOSE TAGS THAT ARE INSIDE THE FOOD TAGS YOU COULD SAY THAT THEY sp BELONG sp UM sp TO TO THAT TO THAT FOOD TAG sp UM {SL} YEAH sp OK sp WHAT TYPE OF CODING IS THIS {SL} UM sp OBJECT- OBJECT ORIENTED sp CODING sp OK sp AND WHAT IS A BENEFIT OF CODING INFORMATION THIS WAY sp UM {SL} IT HELPS TO UH {SL} sp IT HELPS TO TO ACCESS UM {SL} SPECIFIC sp UM {SL} IT HELPS HELPS WITH SEPARATION OF INFORMATION BASICALLY sp UM sp CAUSE sp YOU HAVE YOU HAVE EACH FOOD OBJECT sp HAS sp HAS UM ALL OF THEIR ALL OF ITS INFORMATION UH ENCAPSULATED sp UM INSIDE OF IT sp UM {SL} {CG} {SL} YEAH sp OK sp ALRIGHT {SL} sp {NS} {SL} WHAT KIND OF GRAPH IS sp THIS sp UH THIS IS A UNWEIGHTED sp UH sp CONNECTED UM sp DIRECTED GRAPH {SL} sp OK sp WHAT IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM sp SEVEN TO TWO sp {SL} LET'S SEE sp UM {SL} WELL SEEING AS sp THE EDGES DON'T HAVE ANY WEIGHTS UM IT WOULD JUST BE THE SHORTEST AMOUNT OF sp EDGES I SUPPOSE UM {SL} AND SO IT WOULD JUST BE sp UM sp FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT TO SIX {SL} sp UH sp TO {SL} TWO sp YOU SAID sp TWO WAS THE FINAL ONE RIGHT YEAH OK sp YEAH	WE'LL
