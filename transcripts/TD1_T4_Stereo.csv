participant,WE JUST DID sp MHM EXCEPT THIS SO PLEASE EXPLAIN THE THAT WOULD MEAN TO HAVE A CYCLE IN THIS GRAPH sp BECAUSE sp IF YOU START OFF AT ONE sp THERE'S NO WAY TO GET BACK TO ONE sp {SL} OK sp sp THE SET AND HOW MANY CYCLES ARE IN THIS GRAPH {SL} sp UM sp I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS ZERO sp OK sp {SL} sp EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THE SET THIS sp IS A LIST OF sp SOME BIG O NOTATIONS FOR ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY sp GIVING NAMES AND EXAMPLES A sp WHERE YOU CAN sp DESCRIBE TO ME THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPLEXITIES {SL} sp UM sp THE FIRST ONE {SL} IS MOST SIMPLE COMPLEXITY OR EVERYTHING IT'S BASICALLY JUST sp RUNNING A SINGLE sp FORMULA sp LIKE ASKING sp WHAT'S THE VALUE OF sp THREE PLUS FOUR sp UM {SL} THAT'S IN THE SET sp B sp THE SECOND ONE IS LOOPING {SL} N FACTORIAL TIMES I BELIEVE {SL} sp SO {SL} THAT WOULD BE LIKE WHICH WOULD BE A sp RECURSIVE FUNCTION sp ER A FUNCTION WITH TWO RECURSIVE CALLS IN IT I THINK sp {SL} NO ACTUALLY THAT WOULDN'T BE THAT WOULD BE {SL} JUST sp ONE TWO THREE HM sp {SL} THINK THAT WOULD BE A FUNCTION THAT CALLS ITSELF RECURSIVELY sp A NUMBER OF TIMES sp {SL} EQUAL sp FOUR FIVE TO HOW MANY TIMES IT'S BEEN CALLED ALREADY {SL} OR RATHER sp THE OPPOSITE HOW MANY TIMES sp IT HASN'T BEEN CALLED sp MINUS sp SOME NUMBER sp SIX SEVEN EIGHT SAY N sp UM sp THE SECOND ONE JUST LOOPS N TIMES FOR HOWEVER MANY sp THINGS YOU PUT IN SO IT COULD BE LIKE sp ONE PLUS TWO PLUS QUESTION AND ANSWERING {SL} THREE PLUS FOUR sp AND IT WOULD KEEP REPEATING THAT N TIMES {SL} UM {SL} THE THIRD ONE sp ER THE FOURTH ONE RATHER IS sp {SL} UM sp I BELIEVE THAT'S A SEARCH sp OF {SL} UH sp QUICK SORT ER sp NOT SEARCH UH SORT sp QUICK SORT OR sp SOME OTHER KIND OF SORT THE UPSIDE THAT {SL} DOESN'T GO THROUGH IT {SL} ENTIRELY N TIMES sp BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GO THROUGH IT sp JUST ONE TIME sp DOWN U SHAPE IT {SL} sp BREAKS IT UP INTO {SL} SOME NUMBER OF SORTABLE THINGS AND SORTS EACH ONE OF THOSE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SORT THE ENTIRE THING ITSELF {SL} IS sp AND UM sp THE LAST ONE sp IS A FUNCTION THAT JUST sp I BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE A FUNCTION THAT CALLS ITSELF RECURSIVELY TWICE {SL} sp SO IF YOU WERE TO sp WHICH IS sp sp RUN THE FUNCTION FOUR TIMES IT WOULD CALL ITSELF RECURSIVELY TWICE AND sp THEN RECURSIVELY TWICE AGAIN IN EACH ONE OF THOSE AND THEN AGAIN IN EACH ONE OF THOSE sp SO IT WOULD RUN ITSELF N SQUARE BASICALLY THE OVERLAP TIMES {SL} OK sp AND WHICH TYPE OF COMPLEXITY IS BEST sp AND WHY {SL} sp UM {SL} OF THOSE TWO SETS IDEALLY IT'S BEST TO HAVE A COMPLEXITY OF sp BIG O sp OF ONE sp JUST BECAUSE THEN EVERYTHING IS THE SIMPLEST THAT IT CAN POSSIBLY BE sp BUT sp BECAUSE MOST CODE sp CAN'T BE DONE sp {SL} sp LIKE THAT MOST CODE HAS TO BE DYNAMICALLY PROCESSED sp IT'S IDEAL TO EITHER HAVE sp A BIG O sp OF LOG N sp OR OF sp N SO THE sp OVERLAP sp BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE {SL} sp LOWEST FEASIBLE VALUES THAT YOU COULD USE {SL} sp I GUESS {SL} IT AS IF YOU'RE TUTORING OF sp B OK {SL} SO WHAT IS A VERTEX sp AND HOW MANY VERTICES ARE THERE {SL} AND C sp sp A VERTEX sp IS sp {SL} A SINGLE POINT {SL} AND A VERTICE IS WOULD BE {SL} IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A LINE BUT IT'S BASICALLY THE sp THE THING THAT CONNECTS TWO VERTEXES SO YOU sp SAID HOW MANY VERTICES ARE THERE SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT MHM sp UM sp FOUR sp EIGHT sp TWELVE VERTICES {SL} CONNECTING THE EIGHT sp DIFFERENT VERTEXES {SL} sp BECAUSE THAT'S THE OK sp WHAT IS AN EDGE sp AND HOW MANY EDGES ARE THERE {SL} OH {LG} I sp I CONFUSED sp VERTICE AND EDGE AN EDGE IS ONLY THING THAT B AND C WHAT CONNECTS THE VERTEX sp AND THERE'S TWELVE EDGES AND sp EIGHT sp VERTEXES {SL} OK sp HOW LONG IS sp THE HAVE IN COMMON {SL} SHORTEST PATH sp FROM ONE TO sp SIX {SL} UM {SL} IF YOU INCLUDE THE POINT SIX IN IT IT WOULD BE NINE sp YOU'D GO FROM ONE TO TWO TO SIX sp OTHERWISE IT WOULD JUST BE THREE FROM ONE TO TWO TO SIX {SL} OK {SL} AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT sp AND sp THREE sp AND TWO ARE ADJACENT sp {SL} sp UM sp IF YOU WERE ON THE POINT sp EITHER THREE OR TWO YOU COULD TRAVEL TO THE OTHER ONE sp ADJACENT MEANS THE OVERLAP YOU CAN GO FROM ONE TO THE OTHER {SL} OK {SL} sp ALRIGHT SO WE ARE sp ALMOST sp DONE WE JUST NEED TO ME sp OK sp OF A sp AND C CALIBRATE THE EYE TRACKER GLASSES ONE MORE TIME sp ALRIGHT {SL} sp WOULD BE NOTHING sp BECAUSE ALRIGHT sp SO YOU ARE ALL DONE sp OUT sp UM sp YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE OFF THE EYE TRACKER sp AND WE JUST NEED TO HAVE YOU FILL OUT A QUICK sp SURVEY OF ONE TWO AND THREE sp AND SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THERE'S NO sp ELEMENTS THAT ARE SHARED AND AGAIN IF IN COMMON sp UM sp A sp TIMES D sp JUST MEANS BASICALLY sp ALL OF THE ELEMENTS IN A TIMES ALL OF THE ELEMENTS IN D YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE ANSWER sp WHICH WOULD BE sp X TWO X THREE X sp AND sp Y TWO Y THREE Y I THINK sp MHM {SL} IS PLEASE TRY TO GUESS sp OK {SL} sp AND GIVEN THE SETS ON THE RIGHT sp UM WHAT SETS WOULD BE THE ANSWERS TO THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE LEFT sp {SL} sp AND IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY SO {SL} UM {SL} I'M SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THAT sp YEAH THAT'S OK sp SO GIVEN THE SETS ON THE RIGHT NO IDEA JUST SAY sp WHICH SETS WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE LEFT sp {SL} THAT YOU'D LIKE TO sp SKIP sp sp HM {SL} TIME WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT AND WE CAN SKIP THE QUESTION I'M sp I'M NOT SURE IF sp IF THAT'S A {SL} sp NOT REALLY SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT sp ALRIGHT sp sp SORRY sp NO THAT'S OK sp THAT'S OK sp WE'LL sp SKIP IT {SL}
facilitator,OK
participant,WHAT IS THE ROOT ALRIGHT sp AND WE ARE NODE {SL} sp UM THE ROOT NODE WOULD BE FIFTY sp WHICH IS sp THE NODE THAT ALL OTHER NODES sp CONSTANTLY IF YOU KEEP GOING BACK UP WOULD GO UP TO sp GOING TO DO sp OK sp WHAT IS THE PARENT NODE OF NINETEEN sp THE PARENT NODE OF NINETEEN IS TWENTY THREE sp THE NODE sp JUST ABOVE NINETEEN sp OK sp WHAT UM JUST A QUICK CALIBRATION ARE THE CHILD NODES OF SEVENTY TWO sp CHILD NODES OF SEVENTY TWO ARE FIFTY FOUR AND SEVENTY SIX sp JUST THE NODES THAT ARE ONE BELOW SEVENTY TWO sp OK AGAIN sp {SL} AND WHAT ARE THE SIBLING NODES OF sp TWELVE {SL} sp UH THE SIBLING NODES WOULD BE {SL} TWENTY THREE SO sp PLEASE JUST WATCH sp THE DOTS sp BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH RELATED TO SEVENTEEN sp AND I'M NOT SURE IF FIFTY sp FIFTY FOUR AND SEVENTY SIX WOULD COUNT I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD COUNT AS SIBLING NODES sp JUST {SL} BECAUSE THEY'RE {SL} I GUESS THEY'D BE CALLED COUSIN NODES IF THAT'S A THING sp {SL} OK OK {SL} WHAT sp SPECIAL TYPE OF FUNCTION IS sp THIS {SL} sp UM sp THIS IS A RECURSIVE FUNCTION {SL} WHICH MEANS THAT sp THE FUNCTION CALLS ITSELF SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF THE FUNCTION {SL} SOME BASIC MATH sp AND PROGRAMMING sp YEAH sp OK sp AND WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO sp UM sp YOU PUT IN {SL} TWO NUMBERS sp X AND Y sp AND IF Y IS ZERO sp THEN IT'LL sp JUST RETURN X sp BUT IF Y IS NOT ZERO THEN IT'LL sp {SL} DO THE SAME THING sp BUT INSTEAD OF sp INPUTTING sp X AND Y sp IT'LL PUT IN Y AND X MODULUS Y WHICH sp MEANS sp Y sp AND sp THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN sp OR RATHER THE REMAINDER IF sp X IS DIVIDED BY Y {SL} SO IF YOU KEEP DOING THIS I THINK IT sp SHOULD GIVE YOU THE GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR sp UH AND sp THAT'S PARTIALLY JUST BECAUSE THE NAME OF THE FUNCTION IS GCD {SL} I'M NOT sp SURE sp UM {SL} sp HM {SL} YEAH I THINK THIS SHOULD RETURN THE GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR {SL} I BELIEVE {SL} OK {SL} OK {SL} WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} CONCEPTS I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO PUT EVERYTHING IN ORDER sp BUT {SL} I DON'T THINK THAT IT'LL ACTUALLY sp CORRECTLY PUT EVERYTHING IN ORDER IT'LL JUST sp GO DOWN THE LIST OF {SL} I ASSUME IT'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE A LIST OF sp INTS sp OR NUMBERS sp AND IF sp THE sp NUMBER IS sp IS LOWER THAN THE NUMBER {SL} OR RATHER IF sp A NUMBER IS ABOVE sp THE NUMBER AFTER IT sp WAIT {SL} sp YEAH IF A NUMBER IS ABOVE THE NUMBER AFTER IT THEN IT JUST SWAPS THE ORDER OF THOSE TWO NUMBERS {SL} AND THEN IT sp KEEPS DOING THAT FOR ALL OF THE NUMBERS IN THE SET {SL} OK sp AND WHAT IS THE FORMAL NAME FOR THIS sp TYPE OF FUNCTION {SL} I THINK IT WOULD BE CALLED A SORT {SL} JUST BECAUSE IT SORTS A LIST sp {SL} sp I sp THINK {SL} OH I THINK THIS sp IS sp UM sp CALLED BUBBLE SORT ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT KEEPS GOING THROUGH THE LIST UNTIL {SL} sp EVERYTHING IS sp ER NOTHING HAS BEEN SWAPPED sp SO YEAH sp I BELIEVE THIS IS BUBBLE SORT AND THAT IT ACTUALLY DOES WORK {SL} OK sp IT'S JUST VERY SLOW {SL} OK sp {SL} SO EXPLAIN EACH OF THE SYMBOLS ON THE LEFT {SL} UM {SL} THE UPSIDE DOWN A sp I BELIEVE sp SO FOR THESE STANDS FOR sp ALL OF {SL} MEANING sp FOR THE FIRST EXAMPLE ON TOP sp ALL OF X sp SUCH THAT sp L OF X IMPLIES P OF X sp OR RATHER sp EVERY TIME sp EVERY POSSIBLE sp THING THAT X COULD BE sp L OF X sp IMPLIES P OF X IS TRUE {SL} SAME FOR THE SECOND THING C OF X sp OR sp {SL} U OF X I BELIEVE THAT STANDS FOR sp UH THE SECOND SYMBOL ON THE LEFT sp THE BACKWARDS E sp I THINK IS SOME sp WHICH MEANS sp THERE sp BASICALLY MEANS THERE sp ARE SOME CONDITIONS THAT sp THIS'LL END UP BEING TRUE {SL} sp SO FOR THE THIRD ONE ON THE RIGHT THERE ARE SOME VALUES OF X WHERE sp R OF X sp AND L OF X IS TRUE sp UM sp THE THIRD THING ON THE LEFT sp DOWN THE sp THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A V sp I BELIEVE STANDS FOR {SL} OR sp I sp THINK sp IT MIGHT BE AND {SL} sp I THINK IT'S OR sp AND THE UPSIDE DOWN V IS AND {SL} AND THEN THE ARROW sp MEANS {SL} THE FIRST THING IMPLIES THE SECOND THING sp SO FOR THE sp FIRST THING L OF X IMPLIES P OF X sp OR sp L OF X sp {SL} UM I THINK sp IF sp L OF X THEN P OF X sp IS THE WAY THAT YOU PUT IT IN {SL} NON {SL} MATHEMATICAL SPEAK {SL} OK {SL} AND USING THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE RIGHT sp CREATE LEAST sp AT LEAST sp ONE EXAMPLE sp UM AND YOU CAN DEFINE THE VARIABLES HOWEVER YOU WANT sp UH IS THAT ONE EXAMPLE OF EACH QUESTIONS JUST sp OR JUST sp ONE EXAMPLE sp UM JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF ANY sp ALRIGHT sp UM sp {SL} WELL THE LAST ONE sp WOULD BE sp THERE'S SOME sp X AND ALL Y sp SUCH THAT sp E OF X AND Y sp WHICH sp COULD BE PUT IN OTHER TERMS AS UH sp IF sp X IS {SL} sp UM {SL} sp UH {SL} CATS THAT LIKE sp DOG FOOD sp AND Y IS DOGS THAT LIKE DOG FOOD sp AND E IS sp SUCH LIKES DOG FOOD sp THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THERE ARE SOME CATS THAT LIKE DOG FOOD sp AND sp ALL DOGS LIKE DOG FOOD {SL} OK sp {SL} ON A WEBSITE THIS WOULD PRODUCE sp WHAT DOES EXAMPLE A B sp AND sp C LOOK LIKE {SL} UM sp EXAMPLE A sp WOULD BE sp TYPED IN ARIAL sp WITH sp A BACKGROUND OF sp PINK AND THE TEXT ITSELF WOULD BE RED {SL} UH JUST BECAUSE IT'S IN sp HEADER ONE AND THAT'S HOW YOU DEFINED HEADER ONE sp EXAMPLE B WOULD BE sp ALIGNED IN THE CENTER sp AND IT WOULD BE BLUE TEXT {SL} UM {SL} THE FONT WOULD BE sp TIMES NEW ROMAN sp OR JUST TIMES RATHER sp AND THE sp BACKGROUND WOULD BE GREY BECAUSE sp THAT'S WHAT THE BODY sp ER THE {SL} YEAH THAT'S HOW THE BODY DEFINE sp FONT AND BACKGROUND {SL} AND sp EXAMPLE C WOULD BE sp YELLOW BACKGROUND ASSUME THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING BECAUSE THE {SL} UH I CAN'T sp REMEMBER THE NAME FOR IT BUT sp THE sp P OVERRIDES BODY BECAUSE IT'S sp BASICALLY IT'S CLOSER TO P THAN IT IS TO BODY sp SO IT'D BE A YELLOW BACKGROUND sp GREEN TEXT IN TIMES NEW ROMAN sp FONT {SL} OK {SL} sp DESCRIBE TO ME USING THE PICTURE WHAT A LOOP IS {SL} sp UM {SL} A LOOP sp WOULD BE {SL} IF YOU'RE sp ON THE POINT THAT HAS A VALUE OF FIVE {SL} AND YOU GO sp FROM FIVE TO FIVE sp YOU WOULD HAVE LOOPED sp FROM FIVE TO FIVE sp UM IF YOU'RE ON ONE OF THE POINTS THAT HAS A VALUE OF sp THREE AND YOU GO TO THE OTHER POINT THAT HAS A VALUE OF THREE sp YOU'RE NOT LOOPING BECAUSE THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE VALUES sp BUT IF YOU GO FROM THREE TO THREE TO FIVE TO TWO TO THREE sp THEN YOU WOULD HAVE sp DONE A LOOP BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE GONE FROM ONE PLACE sp AROUND AND THEN BACK TO THE SAME PLACE {SL} THERE sp OK sp AND HOW MANY LOOPS ARE THERE IN THIS PICTURE {SL} sp UM sp YOU COULD LOOP sp FROM FIVE TO FIVE sp WE GO OK sp ON THE LEFT ARE EXPRESSIONS YOU COULD LOOP FROM FIVE THREE sp TWO FIVE {SL} JUST THAT TRIANGLE YOU COULD DO sp THE sp PENTAGON WHICH IS ALL FIVE OF THOSE sp OR YOU COULD AND ON JUST DO THE SQUARE OF sp THREE THREE FIVE TWO sp SO {SL} I THINK FOUR sp LOOPS BY MY COUNT sp {SL} ABOUT THESE MATHEMATICAL THE RIGHT ARE SETS {SL} OK sp AND WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THE ZERO VERTEX {SL} UH {SL} sp I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT IT'S UM sp IT'S A VERTEX THAT'S NOT CONNECTED TO ANY OTHER UH sp VERTEX {SL} sp UM {SL} SO ON THE LEFT I WANNA SAY UNCONNECTED VERTEX BUT sp I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE NAME OF IT {SL} I I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT I'M GONNA HAVE TO PASS sp OK sp THAT'S OK {SL} WHAT DO THE U SO DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS HERE {SL} SHAPE sp THE UPSIDE DOWN UM {SL} THERE'S sp U AND THE X THIS sp THIS IS A MENU sp AND IT'LL GIVE sp THE NAME OF AN ITEM THE PRICE OF THE ITEM sp A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE ITEM sp AND HOW MANY CALORIES ARE IN THE ITEM sp SYMBOLS MEAN sp {SL} OK sp AND WHAT TYPE OF CODING IS sp THIS {SL} UM I sp THINK THIS IS HTML CODING {SL} sp THE I I'M NOT REALLY SURE I CAN'T REMEMBER {SL} I THINK HTML OR {SL} MAYBE UM {SL} sp U SHAPE JAVASCRIPT sp NOT JAVASCRIPT {SL} UM sp YEAH HTML OR JAVASCRIPT I THINK I'M NOT SURE OK {SL} THEORIES sp sp MEANS sp AND WHAT IS A BENEFIT OF CODING INFORMATION THIS sp WAY {SL} UM {SL} sp YOU HAVE A {SL} {SL} A STANDARD UM sp FORMULA THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW FOR EVERY ITEM sp SO IF YOU HAVE A HUGE MENU sp IT WOULDN'T BE THAT HARD TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO NAME PRICE DESCRIPTION UH IT'S AND HOW MANY CALORIES sp ARE sp IN EACH ITEM IN THAT MENU {SL} sp OK {SL} BEEN A WHILE I THINK WHAT KIND OF GRAPH IS sp THIS {SL} UH {SL} IT'S sp OR UH I sp CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME sp UM {SL} sp I THINK IT'S CALLED A CARTESIAN sp NO THAT'S NOT A CARTESIAN GRAPH {SL} I I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THIS GRAPH I'M sp SORRY I'M GONNA HAVE SO {SL} TO PASS sp OK sp THAT'S OK sp WHAT IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM sp SEVEN TO TWO {SL} IF IT'S sp UM sp IT WOULD BE GOING FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT sp TO SIX TO TWO {SL} I THINK IT'S ALSO THE ONLY PATH FROM SEVEN TO TWO {SL} sp A OR OK {SL} WHAT IS A sp CYCLE sp ALSO CALLED A ROUTE OR A TOUR sp UM sp A CYCLE B sp IS A PATH THAT STARTS FROM ONE POINT sp AND GOES sp TO EVERY OTHER POINT sp AND THEN ENDS UP BACK AT THE SAME POINT THAT IT STARTED sp UM sp YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE
