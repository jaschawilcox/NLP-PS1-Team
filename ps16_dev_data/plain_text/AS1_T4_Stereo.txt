{SL} GOOD OK EXCELLENT ALRIGHT THEN THE NEXT SESSION IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE JUST DID EXCEPT THIS TIME WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT SOME BASIC MATH AND PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS INSTEAD OK SO FOR THESE QUESTIONS ASSUME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE MATHEMATICAL THEORIES PLEASE EXPLAIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER IT LIKE YOU'RE TUTORING ME OK AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE NOT SURE THE ANSWER PLEASE TRY TO GUESS AND IF YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY UNSURE OK JUST TELL ME THAT YOU WANT TO SKIP THE QUESTION OK GREAT I'M NOT GOOD WITH REMEMBERING TERMINOLOGY BUT I AM OK WITH REMEMBERING HOW STUFF WORKS OK SYNTAX OK {LS} THAT'S GREAT LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW JUST DO YOUR BEST TO GUESS IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE ANSWER IS AND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY NO GRADING {LS} SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO START OFF BY CALIBRATING THE EYE TRACKER AGAIN {SL} ON THE LEFT ARE EXPRESSIONS AND ON THE RIGHT ARE SETS SO ON THE LEFT WHAT DO THE U UPSIDE-DOWN U AND X SYMBOLS MEAN {SL} OH {SL} AH CRAP IT'S BEEN LIKE OVER A YEAR SINCE I'VE DONE THIS PART UM {SL} I DON'T KNOW I WAS AT FIRST GOING TO GUESS FLOORS BUT UM {SL} AH AND I KNOW THE X WAS TIMES BUT {SL} I CAN'T REMEMBER IF ONE OF THEM WAS INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE UM THE FACT THAT THE C IS THERE DOESN'T HELP {SL} {BR} {SL} I'M NOT QUITE SURE {SL} IT'S OK TO BE HONEST IT'S OK WE CAN SKIP IT {SL} WHAT IS THE ROOT NODE OF THIS GRAPH UM FIFTY OK AND WHAT IS THE PARENT NODE OF NINETEEN {SL} UH N- TWENTY THREE {SL} OK WHAT ARE THE CHILD NODES OF SEVENTY TWO {SL} UH FIFTY FOUR AND SEVENTY SIX {SL} OK AND WHAT ARE THE SIBLING NODES OF TWELVE {SL} UH NINE AND FOURTEEN {SL} OK {SL} WHAT SPECIAL TYPE OF FUNCTION IS THIS {SL} I DON'T KNOW THE F ER EXACT FUNCTION BUT IT USES UH AN IF STATEMENT {SL} UH LET'S SEE IF Y EQUALS ZERO RETURN X {SL} I'VE I'M NOT SURE I'VE EVER SEEN THIS ONE YET ACTUALLY OK {SL} UM SO I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT TYPE OF FUNCTION IT IS UH {SL} OK WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} IF IT DOESN'T RETURN Y EQUALS ZERO IT CALLS ITSELF UNTIL UM {SL} {BR} {SL} {NS} UH LET'S SEE {SL} X MODULO Y SO IF Y DOESN'T EQUAL ZERO IT CALLS ITSELF AND IT CHANGES THE VARIABLES SO THAT UH {SL} WELL IT BASICALLY KEEPS GOING UNTIL IT UM Y EQUALS ER IT KEEPS DOING UH X MODULO Y UNTIL UH Y EQUALS ZERO BUT IT CHANGES THE PLACEMENT OF X AND Y EACH TIME {SL} SO I'M NOT QUITE POSITIVE ALTHOUGH I DO IT DOES CHANGE BOTH VARIA- IT'S MEANT TO UH CHANGE X BY A CERTAIN FACTOR UNTIL IT GETS TO A CERTAIN POINT OK GREAT WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT ONE {BR} {SL} WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} UH I'M SO T- I'M SO TERRIBLE AT REMEMBERING UH {NS} {SL} WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS THIS EXACTLY {SL} I THINK IT'S PSEUDOCODE OH PSEUDOCODE OK UM {SL} I'VE I'VE NEVER SEEN A TO STATEMENT OR A DO STATEMENT {SL} UH {SL} A LIST {SL} {NS} OH IT ORDERS A LIST {SL} IT BASICALLY ORDERS THE UH IT ORDERS THE LIST FROM LEAST TO GREATEST {SL} ALTHOUGH I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT {SL} BUT IT DOES AT THE VERY LEAST MOVE EVERYTHING CLOSER TO BEING FROM LEAST TO GREATEST {SL} OK AND WHAT'S THE FORMAL NAME FOR OH WAIT IT'S UNTIL UNTIL NOT SWAPPED SO IT IS {SL} UM {SL} IT IS UNTIL UH IT ORDERS ALL THE WAY THROUGH OK I DON'T QUITE REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE FUNCTION AS I SAID I'M TERRIBLE WITH NAMES FOR TERMINOLOGY SURE SURE THAT'S OK ALRIGHT GREAT {SL} EXPLAIN EACH OF THE SYMBOLS ON THE LEFT UM {SL} THE TURN A IS UH FOR EVERY {SL} UM THE E WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT FOR EVERY BLANK THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE UM THE BACKWARDS E MEANS EXISTS WHICH MEANS THAT {SL} THERE IS A SITUATION WHERE THAT EXISTS {SL} I BELIEVE THE V WAS OR AND THE UPSIDE-DOWN V WAS AND {SL} OR MEANS THAT UH {SL} IT IS ONE OR THAT IT IS ONE OR BOTH OF THEM IS TRUE UH CAUSE XOR IS SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT REPRESENTS THE UPSIDE-DOWN V IS AND WHICH MEANS THAT BOTH CASES ARE TRUE AND THE ARROW MEANS IMPLIES WHICH MEANS THAT THEY ARE EITHER BOTH FALSE UM {SL} I IF I REMEMBER IT'S EITHER BOTH FALSE ONE'S FALSE AND THE ONE ON THE OTHER END IS TRUE BUT IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT UM ONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ARROW IS TRUE AND THE OTHER ONE IS FALSE OK {SL} OK AND USING THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE RIGHT CREATE AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE AND YOU CAN DEFINE THE VARIABLES HOWEVER YOU WANT {SL} UH {SL} OH YOU MEAN FOR EACH OF THEM JUST FOR ONE {SL} UH {SL} GOD IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE DONE THIS UH {SL} FOR EVERY X UM {SL} FOR EVERY X UH C UH X AND FOR EVERY X C X AND U X UH {SL} ER WAIT I I FEEL LIKE X MEANT SOMETHING TOO OR AT LEAST THAT SPECIFIC KIND OF X {SL} BUT FOR EVERY UM FOR EVERY CASE C IS UH C IS THE SAME AS V WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR FALSE OK {SL} ALRIGHT {SL} ON A WEBSITE THIS WOULD PRODUCE WHAT DOES EXAMPLE A B AND C LOOK LIKE {SL} UM {SL} WELL A WOULD BE UH EXAMPLE A IN BIG LETTERS AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE EXAMPLE B WOULD BE IN QUITE S- SOMEWHAT SMALLER LETTERS AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE AND EXAMPLE C WOULD BE IN UM MUCH LITTLER AH ER EXAMPLE B WOULD BE SLIGHTLY BELOW A AND THEN EXAMPLE C WOULD BE IN DECENTLY SMALLER LETTERS BELOW ALL THAT {SL} DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE REST OF IT DOES TOO OR UM NO JUST ER OH WAIT OH NO UH EXAMPLE ONE WOULD ALSO BE UH IN THE ARIAL FONT {SL} UM WITH A PINK BOX AROUND IT WITH UH THE FONT COLORED RED {SL} UM WHEREAS UM {SL} H TWO {SL} H TWO WOULD BE UH OH YEAH AND H ONE WOULD ALSO BE OVER TO THE LEFT H TWO WOULD BE CENTERED MEANING IT'S NEAR THE MIDDLE UH IN REGARDS TO LEFT AND RIGHT UM AND IT WOULD BE COLORED BLUE {SL} UH AND IT WOULD HAVE NO BACKGROUND COLOR I DON'T QUITE REMEMBER IF THAT WOULD MAKE THE BACKGROUND WHITE OR STILL PINK FROM THE HEADER ONE BUT IT DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE UH PINK I THINK IT WOULD BE WHITE {SL} UM AND THEN EXAMPLE C WOULD HAVE A BOX AROUND IT COLORED YELLOW AND THE TEXT WOULD BE COLORED GREEN AND IT WOULD BE ON THE LEFT {SL} AND THE BACKGROUND ER WAIT NO THE BACKGROUND FOR H TWO WOULD BE GREY BECAUSE THAT'S HOW {SL} OH WELL NO I FORGET THE HEADER COUNT'S IN THE BODY I DON'T I'M NOT SURE MOST OF THE PAGE WOULD BE GREY I BELIEVE THE BACKGROUND FOR EXAMPLE B WOULD BE GREY OK {SL} GREAT {SL} DESCRIBE TO ME USING THE PICTURE WHAT A LOOP IS {SL} UM {SL} A LOOP IS WHEN A NUMBER CAN CALL IS WHEN ER NOT A NUMBER BUT I GUESS A NODE CAN CALL ITSELF SO IT CAN TRAVERSE RIGHT BACK TO ITSELF WITHOUT HAVING TO TRAVERSE TO ANOTHER ONE {SL} OK SO YOU CAN GO ONE- FROM ONE TO THREE FROM THREE TO THE DIFFERENT THREE FROM THREE TO THE FIVE AND THEN FROM FIVE BACK TO THE FIVE {SL} OK HOW MANY LOOPS ARE IN THIS PICTURE {SL} ER WAIT NO THAT'S ACTUALLY {SL} OH THE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS OK {SL} UM {SL} SO I THINK I HAD THAT WRONG {SL} BUT {SL} IN THAT SITUATION THERE ARE {SL} I WOULD SAY {SL} ARE BY MY FIRST DEFINITION THERE'S ONE LOOP BUT {SL} BY ANOTHER DEFINITION IF I RECALL IT'S WHEN YOU CAN START AT ONE POINT AND THEN GO ALL THE WAY BACK AROUND TO IT WITHOUT PASSING OVER THE SAME ONE TWICE {SL} AND BY THAT DEFINITION {SL} UM THERE WOULD BE ONE {SL} UH {SL} ONE TWO THREE {SL} LOOPS THERE'D BE THE THREE THE TWO AND THE FIVE THE THREE THE THREE AND THE FIVE AND THE TWO AND THE THREE THE THREE THE TWO THE FIVE AND THE TWO {SL} OK {SL} GREAT AND WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THE ZERO VERTEX {SL} UH {SL} AN ORPHAN {SL} I'M I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE PROPER TERM- TERMINOLOGY BUT THAT'S WHAT I'D UM CALL IT OK GREAT {SL} GOD IT FEELS LIKE IT'S BEEN AGES SINCE I'VE DONE SOME OF THIS STUFF THAT'S ALRIGHT I NEED A REFRESHER ON SOME OF THIS {SL} OK DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS HERE {SL} WELL THERE IS THE PRICE OF THE WAFFLES THE KINDS OF FOODS AVAILABLE {SL} THE UH THERE IS THE CALORIES FOR THE WAFFLES {SL} UM {SL} AND THERE'S DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE TYPES OF WAFFLES {SL} OK WHAT KIND OF CODING IS THIS {SL} UM {SL} WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY WHAT KIND OF CODING LIKE THE NAME FOR THE FORMAT OR THE TYPE IT WOULD BE USED THE NAME FOR THE FORMAT {SL} UM {SL} I AM NOT HONESTLY SURE AS I SAID I'M TERRIBLE WITH TERMINOLOGY OK THAT'S OK WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF CODING INFORMATION THIS WAY {SL} UM {SL} {NS} {SL} I'M NOT SURE I'VE EX- QUITE EXPERIENCED THIS TYPE BEFORE UH I MAY HAVE AND FORGOTTEN IT BUT {SL} UM ONE BENEFIT IS THAT {SL} ALL OF THE UH TYPES APPEAR TO HAVE THE SAME I GUESS YOU'D SAY VARIABLES {SL} SO IT IT APPEARS FAIRLY ORGANIZED MHM AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE FAIRLY EASY TO SORT RELATED FACTORS {SL} OK {SL} OK GREAT {SL} AND SEARCH YOU COULD SEARCH STUFF I SUPPOSE MHM {SL} OK WHAT KIND OF GRAPH IS THIS {SL} UM {SL} AH I FORGET WHAT THEY'RE CALLED {SL} UM {SL} IT'S NOT A TR- IT'S NOT A TREE {SL} I I JUST I FORGET WHAT IT'S CALLED THAT'S ALRIGHT WHAT IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM SEVEN TO TWO {SL} UM {SL} ARE TH- ARE THE LINES WEIGHTED {SL} ER WAIT NO THERE THERE ISN'T A PATH ER WAIT NO {SL} THE SHORTEST PATH IS UH EIGHT SIX TWO {SL} AND THE ONLY PATH REALLY UNLESS YOU GO EIGHT SIX SEVEN EIGHT SIX SEVEN HOWEVER MANY TIMES BACK TO TWO UH BUT YOU HAVE TO GO OVER SIX TO GET TO TWO SO EIGHT SIX TWO IS THE SHORTEST PATH OK {SL} GREAT WHAT IS A CYCLE ALSO CALLED A ROUTE OR A TOUR {SL} IF I RECALL A CYCLE {SL} SEE I DON'T REMEMBER HEARING ONE CALLED A TOUR BEFORE I KNOW WE'VE GONE OVER THIS KIND OF THING I I REMEMBER EU- EULER CIRCUITS AND STUFF STUFF LIKE THAT BUT UM {SL} I WANNA SAY IT'S A UH MEANDER THAT VISITS ALL OF THEM ONCE {SL} OR IT COULD BE ONE THAT GOES THE SAME WAY THIS AROUND THE SAME THING {SL} BUT I'M GONNA SAY ONE THAT UH VISITS ALL OF THEM ONCE ESPECIALLY CAUSE YOU SAID A TOUR AND THAT'S WHAT A TOUR MAKES ME THINK OF OK {SL} HOW MANY TOURS ARE IN THIS GRAPH {SL} UM {SL} WELL {SL} IF IT HAS TO PASS OVER ALL OF THEM ONCE THERE ARE NONE {SL} BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS OVER ALL OF THEM ONCE UM {SL} IF IT DOESN'T BUT IT CAN'T LIKE JUST LOOP INFINITELY THEN THERE WOULD HAVE TO {SL} BE ONE CAUSE AS SOON AS YOU GET TO THREE YOU CAN ONLY GO TO NINE {SL} UM AND YOU CAN ONLY GET TO THREE FROM FIVE WHICH CAN ONLY BE REACHED BY FOUR {SL} WHICH CAN ONLY BE REACHED BY TWO {SL} BUT THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO VISIT FOUR TWICE UM IS WHY I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS THE UH {SL} KIND THAT IS UH {SL} IF IT IS THE FACT THAT IT HAS TO GO TO ALL OF THEM ONCE THEN IT THEN IT HAS NONE BUT OTHERWISE IT HAS ONE OK {SL} ALRIGHT {SL} THIS IS A LIST OF SOME BIG-O NOTATION FOR ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY OH I'VE FORGOTTEN THIS BUT I'LL TRY OK SO GIVING NAMES AND EXAMPLES WHERE YOU CAN DESCRIBE TO ME THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPLEXITIES UH {SL} AH {SL} I KNOW O O OF ONE IS BASICALLY A CONSTANT SO IT MEANS THAT HOWEVER HOWEVER MANY UH TIMES IT ER HOWEVER MANY UH {SL} THINGS ARE BEING OH I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE PROPER TERMINOLOGY NOW HOWEVER MANY UH ARE BEING DONE IT WON'T CHANGE THE UH COMPLEXITY {SL} UH I FORGOT THE EXPLAN- EXPLANATION EXCLAMATION POINT WAS BUT FOR N IT MEANS THAT THE {SL} UH {SL} THE COMPLEXITY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE NUMBER OF FACTORS IN IT FOR N SQUARED IT INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY SO UH IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLEX TO HAVE UH THREE THAN IT IS TO HAVE TWO FOR EXAMPLE UM FOR O LOG N IT'S THE OPPOSITE WHICH MEANS THAT IT CONTINUALLY GETS MORE COMPLEX BUT IT UM {SL} DOESN'T INCREASE IT IT INCREASES KIND OF LIKE {SL} {NS} {NS} UH THAT {SL} OK {SL} OK AND WHICH TYPE OF COMPLEXITY IS BEST AND WHY {SL} UM {SL} WELL THE ONE I JUST GAVE UH EITHER O OF ONE OR O OF LOG N BECAUSE BOTH OF THOSE ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH UH VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF FACTORS THIS IS OVERALL I MEAN IF YOU'RE NOT USING VERY MANY IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER QUITE AS MUCH IF YOU'RE NOT USING AS MANY UH {SL} AS I SAID I'M TERRIBLE AT TERMINOLOGY THAT'S OK {SL} BUT YEAH {SL} OK GREAT {SL} WHAT IS A VERTEX AND HOW MANY VERTICES ARE THERE {SL} A VER- UH -TEX IF I RECALL IS ANYWHERE TWO LINES MEET SO THERE ARE {SL} ANY OF THE NUMBER OF POINTS IS A VERTEX SO THERE'S EIGHT VERTEXES {SL} OK WHAT IS AN EDGE AND HOW MANY EDGES ARE THERE AN EDGE IS A LINE BETWEEN TWO VERTEXES SO THERE'S ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE TWELVE EDGES {SL} OK HOW LONG IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM ONE TO SIX {SL} IN ORDER {SL} OR {SL} THE SHORTEST PATH FROM ONE TO SIX IS TWO EDGES AND IF YOU WANT TO USE THE TWO SHORTEST EDGES GO FIVE SIX {SL} OK HOWEVER THE EDGES DON'T APPEAR WEIGHTED SO OK {SL} AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT THREE AND TWO ARE ADJACENT {SL} THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS AN EDGE BETWEEN THEM OK GREAT THEN THAT'S IT UM FOR THIS SECTION SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO CALIBRATE THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES AGAIN SO IF YOU COULD JUST WATCH THE EXES {SL} ALRIGHT YOU ARE ALL DONE UM WE DO JUST WANNA HAVE YOU
