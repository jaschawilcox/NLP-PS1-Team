RESPOND OUT LOUD OK AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO A QUESTION PLEASE TRY TO GUESS OK AND IF YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY UNSURE JUST TELL ME THAT YOU WANT TO SKIP THE QUESTION OK OK SO FIRST HOW DOES A STUDENT USE MYCOURSES {SL} I MEAN {SL} WELL FOR STARTERS THEY HAVE TO LOG IN SO THEY MUST HAVE AN R I T USER NAME AND PASSWORD UH {SL} I BELIEVE IT'S UNDER MAIN SERVER IS WHAT IT'S CALLED UH HOME SERVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO SERVERS LIKE FOR EACH DEPARTMENT THEY ALSO HAVE UH UM ACCOUNTS UH DEPARTMENTAL ACCOUNTS BUT THIS IS JUST FOR A MAIN GENERIC ACCOUNT FOR MYCOURSES SO FOR EACH R I T STUDENT THEY HAVE TO HAVE YOU KNOW A USER NAME PASSWORD AND THEY LOG IN THROUGH THEIR I GUESS GENERAL ACCOUNT IS HOW I COULD SAY IT BEST OK {SL} UM IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT ME TO UM DESCRIBE TO YOU AS TO WHAT MYCOURSES IS OR UM JUST IN GENERAL IS FINE IT'S UP TO YOU OK LIKE WHAT ELSE WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT MYCOURSES UM THAT'S OK JUST A GENERAL OVERVIEW IS FINE OK SO YOU THAT'S GOOD OK THAT'S GOOD {SL} YOU CAN KEEP GOING IF YOU WANT IT'S UP TO YOU OH YEAH OK ALRIGHT SO ANYWAYS WHEN YOU LOG IN TO MYCOURSES YOU HAVE UH {SL} A MAIN PAGE IN WHICH IT GIVES YOU LIKE {SL} AN OUTLINE OF EACH CLASS YOU'RE TAKING PER SEMESTER OR PER UH TERM UM AS YOU MAY CALL IT DIFFERENTLY UM AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IF YOU HAVE A DISCUSSION FOR A CERTAIN CLASS THEY ALSO GIVE YOU NOTIFICATIONS THROUGH THROUGH THE MAIN PAGE THAT UH YOU HAVE DISCUSSION POSTS THAT YOU WANT TO UH GO TO OR NOT UH SOME INSTRUCTORS REQUIRE IT SOME DON'T I MEAN REALLY IT'S UP TO THEM UH BUT ALSO WHEN YOU CLICK ON A CERTAIN COURSE UM FROM THAT MAIN PAGE UH THAT IS YOU CLICK ON THE ACTUAL COURSE NAME YOU'LL BE PULLED UP TO THE FIRST LIKE IT'S LIKE THEIR MAIN PAGE OF THAT COURSE AND IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT TABS CONTENT UM GRADES QUIZZES WHICH BY THE WAY YOU CAN ALSO DO ONLINE QUIZZES OR YOU CAN SUBMIT YOU KNOW LIKE P D F VERSIONS OF A QUIZ THAT YOU THAT YOUR PROFESSOR ALLOWS YOU TO SUBMIT ONLINE IF HE OR SHE DOES UM THERE'S ALSO UH {SL} UH WHAT ELSE {SL} HANDOUTS SLASH ASSIGNMENTS LIKE THAT YOU CAN GET LIKE AS P D F OR IF YOUR PROFESSOR HAD A LECTURE SESSION AND HE OR SHE HAS A POWER POINT PRESENTATION OR SUCH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY POSTED ON MYCOURSES YOU CAN ACCESS THAT IF YOU MISSED CLASS A CERTAIN DAY AND UH YOU KNOW CHECK YOUR GRADES CHECK YOUR EXAMS UH {SL} ETCETERA AND YOU ALSO HAVE A CLASS LIST OF EVERYBODY WHO'S TAKING THAT COURSE UH YOU KNOW INCLUDING THE INSTRUCTOR AND T A'S IF APPLICABLE O- AND VICE VERSA AND UH {BR} I BELIEVE ONE OTHER THING I KNOW ABOUT MYCOURSES IS THAT USUALLY IF YOU REGISTER THROUGH S I S FOR A CLASS ON MYCOURSES {SL} YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE THAT COURSE UNTIL THE VERY NEXT DAY SO PRETTY MUCH THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR UH WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT MYCOURSES YOU KNOW IN A NUTSHELL OK GREAT UM WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT A STUDENT MIGHT BE CONFUSED ABOUT WHILE USING MYCOURSES OH LIKE UH HOW TO- I MEAN IT'S COMMO- IT WAS COMMON FOR ME EARLIER TOO LIKE HOW TO NAVIGATE UH THROUGH WHEN THEY SAY SELECT A COURSE BECAUSE THEY'LL PROBABLY THINK THAT YOU KNOW {SL} AT LEAST WHEN I DID IT OLD ARCHIVES MEANS THAT IT COULD BE IMPLIED THAT IT'S THEIR CURRENT COURSE OR WHATNOT SO THEY COULD GET A LITTLE BUT UM {SL} CONFUZZLED BY THAT INFORMATION OR ONE OTHER THING THAT THEY COULD GET CONFUSED ABOUT IS LIKE {SL} THE DIFFERENT ICONS AND WHAT THEY MEAN SO I MEAN FOR ONE THING YOU KNOW THE EMAIL ICON LIKE THE UH SNAIL MAIL LIKE WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL IT {BR} I BELI- THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE IS FOR JUST YOU KNOW {BR} GENERAL EMAILS PER SE SENT THROUGH MYCOURSES {BR} BUT OF COURSE THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT MYCOURSES IS THE SAME AS EMAIL BECAUSE YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT IS NOT MYCOURSES IT'S R I T'S UH OWN SERVER THROUGH GMAIL AND AS WELL AS UH WHAT UH PAPER THERE'S LIKE A PAPER AND PEN ICON I BELIEVE IT IS IN THE TOP RIGHT CORNER THAT COULD YOU KNOW FIRST YEAR STUDENTS MIGHT NOT GET WHAT THAT IS BUT UM I THINK ANYWAYS WHEN YOU {SL} UH SEE LIKE A RED DOT THAT USUALLY JUST INDICATES THAT YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO UM {SL} YOU KNOW YOU GOT A NEW NOTIFICATION AND STUFF SO YOU GOT TO UH {BR} SEE WHAT IT IS USUALLY IT'S JUST GRADES OR YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THEY JUST GIVE YOU YOU KNOW UH {SL} UH LIKE UPCOMING DUE DATES AND THEN THERE'S ALSO MESSAGES WHICH ALSO LIKE UM MESSAGE NOTIFICATIONS WHICH IS LIKE UM {SL} UH DIRECTED TO YOU FROM YOUR PROFESSOR OR FROM DIRECTED SOLELY TO YOU FROM YOUR PROFESSOR AND OR YOU KNOW PEER I E IT'S NOT PUBLIC SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY A DISCUSSION POST AND SO SO SOME STUDENTS MIGHT INTERMINGLE WITH THAT ALRIGHT YEAH NEXT QUESTION THAT MAKES SENSE GREAT UM WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT A STUDENT MIGHT FIND VERY SIMPLE TO DO ON MYCOURSES UGH I THINK THAT SHOULD BE A NO-BRAINER JUST CLICK ON THE UH ACTUAL COURSE NAME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE OR SHE NEEDS WHAT MATERIALS THEY NEED ANYWAYS TO SUCCESSFULLY PASS IN A COURSE ALSO CHECK YOU KNOW WHERE IT SAYS GRADES YOU KNOW HOW THE STUDENT IS DOING UH YOU KNOW {BR} HOW YOU KNOW ALL THOSE SIMPLE SHENANIGANS WHICH YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU JUST CLICK ON HYPERLINK AND IT JUST TAKES YOU THERE SO {SL} I MEAN THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT THAT MAKES SENSE GOTCHA UM WHAT IS SOMETHING YOU WOULD CHANGE ABOUT MYCOURSES {BR} {SL} I'D PROBABLY {SL} I MEAN I'LL BE HONEST I'M NOT THIS ADVANCED YET TO EVEN YOU KNOW HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T HAVE A SINGLE CLUE ON HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT THIS BUT IF I COULD I'D PROBABLY CHANGE THE ACTUAL INTERFACE OF MYCOURSES TO MAKE IT LOOK LESS DULL LESS LIKE A YOU KNOW LESS LIKE A HOW DO I SAY IT UH {SL} AN ARCHIVED WEBSITE AND MORE LIKE UH {SL} SORT OF LIKE A FACEBOOK-ESQUE LAYOUT SO THAT UH {SL} IT GIVES THE STUDENT IT IT IT LOOKS MORE APPEALING TO STUDENTS SO THAT MYCOURSES LOOKS LIKE FACEBOOK BUT IT'S AN ACADEMIC FACEBOOK IN THAT REGARD HM OK GREAT {SL} UM HOW WOULD YOU MAKE MYCOURSES EASIER TO LEARN FOR NEW STUDENTS {BR} {SL} I MEAN SIMILAR TO HOW FACEBOOK USES THEIR WEBSITE WHEN YOU LOG IN TO FACEBOOK AS A VERY FIRST USER LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU EVER LOG IN TO FACEBOOK THEY GIVE YOU NOTIFICATIONS ON LIKE WHERE TO CLICK WHAT TO NAVIGATE ETCETERA AND WHAT THEY MEAN AND THEY ALSO I BELIEVE THEY HAVE LIKE A HELP ICON AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE S- UH OF THE SITE UM OR YOUR PROFILE WHEN YOU OBTAIN A FACEBOOK PROFILE SO SIMILARLY I'M GO- UH IF I COULD IF I COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR FRESHMAN STUDENTS I WOULD IMPLEMENT A SIMILAR SYSTEM IN WHICH MYCOURSES IS MUCH LIKE FACEBOOK SO THAT {BR} {SL} WHEN A STUDENT FIRST USES MYCOURSES WHICH R I T WILL BE ABLE TO FIRST DETECT THROUGH THEIR SYSTEMS {SL} THE STUDENT CAN OPT TO EITHER {SL} LEARN THROUGH TUTORIALS ON MYCOURSES ALREADY IMPLEMENTED FOR THAT STUDENT OR THEY CAN JUST SKIP THAT STEP AND THEN ALONG THE WAY TRY TO NAVIGATE ON THEIR OWN BUT IF THEY WISH TO SEEK HELP AT ANY POINT IN REGARDS TO HOW TO NAVIGATE MYCOURSES THERE'S ALWAYS THAT HELP ICON ON THE VERY LOWER SCREEN SO IF THE INTERFACE AGAIN IF IT LOOKS LIKE FACEBOOK THEN THEY'LL BE ABLE TO FAMILIARIZE WITH MYCOURSES IN THAT WAY AND KNOW THAT YOU KNOW MUCH LIKE FACEBOOK THE HELP ICON IN MYCOURSES IS WHERE THE HELP ICON ON FACEBOOK WOULD BE {SL} MAKES SENSE {SL} OK AND HOW WOULD YOU MAKE MYCOURSES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES {SL} {BR} {SL} I MEAN IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE DISABILITY I MEAN WHAT KIND OF DISABILITY ARE WE TALKING HERE {SL} ANYTHING THAT COMES TO MIND {SL} {BR} {SL} WELL I SUPPOSE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE MAYBE UH {SL} DEAF STUDENTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF R I T WELL THERE'S SOME I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT I SHOULD SAY THAT SOME STUDENTS ON THE R I T CAMPUS ARE DEAF SO MAYBE I GUESS FOR DEAF STUDENTS {BR} UH THEY COULD YOU KNOW UM {SL} UH {SL} IF THEY HAVE TROUBLE LIKE UM HM {SL} LIKE IF THERE'S AN AUDIO CLIP {SL} AND THE AUDIO CLIP HAS NO CLOSED CAPTIONS MYCOURSES COULD BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW IN A WAY SIMILAR TO YOUTUBE MYCOURSES COULD BE ABLE TO DETECT {SL} UH VIDEOS THAT {SL} THAT HAVE NO CLOSED CAPTION AND TRY TO CAPTION IT CORRECTLY BASED ON {SL} UH CERTAIN {SL} UH ALGORITHM THAT DETERMINES WHAT THE CORRECT WORD SHOULD BE SO KIND OF LIKE {SL} NO BULL LIKE WHAT FACEBOOK DOE- I MEAN WHAT YOUTUBE DOES BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT CONVOLUTED WORDS BUT MYCOURSES WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT SO I GUESS WE'RE LIKE MAYBE IF IT'S IF UH YOU KNOW AN INSTRUCTOR HAS A LECTURE SESSION OR POSTS A LECTURE YOU KNOW AS VIDEO FORMAT {BR} UH THAT DEAF STUDENT COULD ACCESS CLOSED CAPTIONING YOU KNOW UH THROUGH MYCOURSES SERVER UH AND CAPTION UH {SL} AS A AS FROM MYCOURSES {SL} MHM THAT MAKES SENSE A- COOL ALRIGHT ALRIGHT UM SO THAT'S THE FIRST SECTION NOW I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO USE MYCOURSES SO PLEASE RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS AGAIN OUT LOUD AND ALSO SHOW ME THE STEPS ON THE COMPUTER HERE OK ON THE MONITOR HERE SO AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE NOT SURE THE ANSWER PLEASE TRY TO GUESS AND IF YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY UNSURE PLEASE TELL ME THAT YOU WANT TO SKIP THE QUESTION OK YES SO FIRST HOW WOULD I SIGN IN OK WELL FIRST YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN R I T ACCOUNT UM {SL} I COULD WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT STEP ON HOW TO OBTAIN AN R I T ACCOUNT OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO JUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOG UM JUST LOG ON TO MYCOURSES DIRECTLY THAT'S OK YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND LOG ON OK SO UM FOR STARTERS YOU'VE GOTTA KNOW YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN R I T ACCOUNT OR NOT MAKE SURE BEFORE YOU LOG IN TO MYCOURSES YOU ARE SET WITH HAVING A SEC- HAVING A FINALIZED R I T ACCOUNT PER SE SO ONCE THAT'S ALL GOOD AND DONE WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU TYPE YOUR USER NAME IN SO MINE IS W J L THREE SEVEN THREE EIGHT AND YOU KNOW TYPE IN YOUR PASSWORD WHATEVER THAT IS I'LL JUST DO THAT FOR MINE {SL} UM SO AS YOU KNOW THIS IS MY PROFILE PIC UH THEY GIVE YOU UH NOTIFICATIONS {BR} UM AS I STATED EARLIER YOU KNOW THIS SHOULD BE A NO-BRAINER YOU'VE GOT TO YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW YOUR COURSES THAT YOU COULD TAKE UM I MEAN THAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY TAKING THAT YOU CAN CLICK ON UM {SL} YOU'VE GOT YOUR NOTIFICATIONS EMAIL DON'T CONFUSE THIS WITH THE R I T EMAIL BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOUR R I T EMAIL IT'S JUST DIRECT MESSAGES FROM AN INSTRUCTOR AND WHATNOT UM YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST YOUR CHAT YOU KNOW LIKE A I M CHAT OR WHATNOT AND YOU KNOW WHAT SINCE I'M HERE I'M JUST GONNA KILL TIME AND CHECK WHAT THIS NOTIFICATION IS OH HOLY OH THAT'S GREAT WELL NICE TO KNOW THAT I GOT A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ON SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW ANYWAYS UH YOU KNOW THAT USUALLY I'M NOT REALLY THAT GOOD AT BUT ANYWAYS MOVING ON UM {BR} WHAT YOU DO NEXT IS YOU {SL} WHAT YOU WANNA- WHAT YOU COULD DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHECK YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHECK CONCEPTS OF COMPU- LIKE I FOR FOR ME I'M TAKING SPRING COURSES CONCEPTS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS ALGORITHMS WHATNOT SO WHAT YOU COULD DO YOU COULD DO LIKE YOU KNOW CLICK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT UM YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT {SL} YOU KNOW YOUR TYPICAL CLASS STANDARD UM YOU KNOW NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL HERE I MEAN SO UH AND I'M ONLY SAYING THIS BECAUSE I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT MY COMPUTER SYSTEMS COURSE DOES NOTHING ON MYCOURSES IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THERE SO WHY DON'T I PROVIDE A COURSE IN WHICH THERE IS ACTUAL UM CONTENT THAT I UH {SL} HAVE DONE THROUGH MYCOURSES SO I COULD JUST UH {SL} I OPEN A NEW TAB YOU KNOW {SL} BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY I SO ANYWAYS WHAT YOU COULD DO YOU KNOW THIS I- THIS COURSE I'M TAKING RIGHT NOW THIS IS A VERY UM {NS} FREQUENT THIS IS A V- A COURSE THAT I FREQUENTLY UM {SL} HAVE DISCUSSION POSTS FOR SO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS YOU CAN UH {NS} DID WE LOSE THE MOUSE ACTUALLY SORRY YES MA'AM THAT'S OK I KIND OF LOST OF THE MOUSE RECEPTION OH YEAH TOTALLY NOT YOUR FAULT I'M JUST GOING TO TRY RESTARTING THAT AND HOPEFULLY THAT'LL SOLVE THE PROBLEM {SL} UM BUT WE DON'T NEED TO USE THE MOUSE TOO MUCH SO THAT'S OK OK {SL} TRY THIS SO ANYWAYS WHAT YOU CAN DO YOU KNOW UM UH FOR ME I TEND TO YOU KNOW UH HANG ON {SL} SO LIKE FOR DISCUSSIONS YOU KNOW {BR} THE NICE THING ABOUT MYCOURSES IS THAT WELL YOU'RE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH YOUR STUDENTS YOUR PEERS YOUR INSTRUCTORS THROUGH THESE DISCUSSION POSTS SO WHAT YOU'RE BASICALLY DOING IS HAVING LIKE A FORUM IT'S ALMOST LIKE IF YOU WERE TO YOU KNOW LIKE YOU KNOW SORT OF LIKE YELP REVIEWS EXCEPT NO REAL BIAS SO WHAT YOU COULD DO IS YOU CAN UH {SL} SO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS UH TAKE TH- YOU KNOW JUST AS YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT UH YOU KNOW {SL} SO {SL} ANY POSTS THAT YOU WANT YOU KNOW LIKE THIS {SL} SOMETHING LIKE THAT UH YOU KNOW YOU YOU'VE GOT UH {SL} UM PEOPLE JUST TELLING YOU I MEAN PEOPLE JUST UM {SL} POSTING THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT A CERTAIN TOPIC USUALLY I SHOULD GIVE- THIS IS A CAVEAT THAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT MYCOURSES USUALLY {BR} DISCUSSIONS ARE NEVER EVER FACTUAL I MEAN BECAUSE {SL} RARELY DO THEY WANT STUDENTS TO BE EXACTLY LIBERAL I MEAN NOT LIBERAL EXACTLY YOU KNOW PRECISE ON MYCOURSES SO YOU YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW LIKE SAY LIKE DO YOUR EQUATIONS ON FA- ON UH MYCOURSES AND SUCH THEY'LL EXPECT YOU TO JUST DO LIKE INSTRUCTORS TEACHING LIKE PHYSICS AND SIMILAR UH ONE ANSWER IS RIGHT CLASS THEY WON'T DO THAT BECAUSE {BR} MYCOURSES IS MORE LIKE A LIBERAL SITE IN THAT REGARD JUST FOR DISCUSSIONS SO MOVING ON UM {SL} UH {SL} YEAH OK MOVING ON GREAT HOW CAN I VIEW MY GRADES FOR A COURSE {SL} OH WELL THAT'S {BR} PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD UM {SL} JUST CLICK ON YOUR COURSE WHAT'S THE NAME- WHATEVER COURSE YOU WANTED TO NOW LET ME GIVE THIS DISCLAIMER FOR

THAT'S THAT'S REALLY ALL DEPENDENT ON YOUR BROWSER SO IF I'M SO FOR HERE LIKE I'M USING GOOGLE CHROME {BR} AND AS I SAW EARLIER THEY ALREADY HAVE LIKE A A TOOL BAR RIGHT DOWN HERE IF I NAVIG- IT JUST DISAPPEARED NO ACTUALLY IT'S HERE SO IF YOU'RE USING GOOGLE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT BROWSER YOU'RE USING IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD IT TO YOUR ACTUAL {BR} COMPUTER HAR- COMPUTER SO IF YOU WANT SO FOR

ANY RATE THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT THROUGH MYCOURSES OK {SL} UM HOW CAN I VIEW PAST COURSES {SL} UH THAT'S PRETTY SIMPLE UH {SL} UM WHAT YOU DO IS SO HERE'S THE THING WHEN YOU'RE ON MYCOURSES ALL YOUR

UH {SL} YOU COULD UH YOU KNOW FIND OUT A GOOD GAME PLAN IF YOU'RE FAILING OR WHATNOT UH IN REGARDS TO HOW TO CONTACT YOUR PROFESSOR THROUGH MYCOURSES {BR} IT'S PROBABLY NOT OPTIMAL FOR THAT IN MY OPINION JUST BECAUSE MYCOURSES {SL} ISN'T SET UP MYCOURSES IS A VERY VERY BASIC WEBSITE LAYOUT IT'S NOT LIKE FACEBOOK WHERE IT'S SO DYNAMIC THAT YOU CAN ALSO HAVE UH {BR} CHAT CHAT BOXES AT THE SAME TIME ALTHOUGH MYCOURSES HAS SOME SOME HAS A SIMILAR FEATURE I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO PROFESSORS DON'T KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT THIS FEATURE OR IF THEY DO THEY JUST DECIDE NOT TO USE IT {BR} UH IT'S JUST REALLY NOT A GREAT SYSTEM IT'S NOT IT'S NOTHING LIKE FACEBOOK SO YOU'RE BETTER OFF YOU KNOW EMAILING YOUR PROFESSOR ABOUT ANY CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE IN REGARDING A COURSE OR YOU COULD UH YOU KNOW SHOOT HIM OR HER A TEXT YOU KNOW GO OLD SCHOOL BUT DON'T DO IT ON MYCOURSES THAT MAKES SENSE UM LET'S SEE HOW CAN I SEND AN EMAIL TO ANOTHER STUDENT IN THE CLASS USING

YOUR UH FRIEND'S OR PROFESSOR'S UH R I T I D UH LOG IN I D OK GREAT AND HOW CAN I THE DISCUSSION BOARD UH {BR} WELL THAT REALLY GOES AS I SAID EARLIER THAT'S HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON WHAT YOUR CLASS IS DOING WITH DISCUSSION BOARD BUT THE GENERAL WAY TO ACCESS THE DISCUSSION BOARD IS YOU CLICK ON YOUR COURSE {SL} AND IT WILL SAY DISCUSSIONS AT THE VERY TOP WHITE BAR WHAT YOU CLICK IS DISCUSSIONS YOU UH GO DOWN TO THE TOPIC IF YOU WANT TO POST BUT BE BE MINDFUL THAT ALSO PROFESSORS HAVE A CERTAIN RESTRICTION IN WHICH THEY'LL UH {SL} UM {SL} LOCK POSTS AFTER A CERTAIN TIME IF YOU ARE TOO LATE {BR}

THEN THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR THE MYCOURSES SECTION SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO CALIBRATE THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES AGAIN OK AND THEN WE'LL JUST TAKE A FIVE TO TEN MINUTE BREAK OK SO LET ME PULL THAT BACK UP HERE {SL} UM {SL} OK SO AGAIN IF YOU COULD JUST WATCH THE SCREEN RIGHT AND JUST FOLLOW THE BLACK EXES YES {SL} OK GREAT UM SO THAT COMPLETES THE FIRST SECTION MHM SO IF YOU COULD JUST
