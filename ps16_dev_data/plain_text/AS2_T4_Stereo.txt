{SL} ALL SET MHM OK GREAT THEN WE'LL GET STARTED AGAIN UM SO THE NEXT SESSION SECTION IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE JUST DID MHM EXCEPT THIS TIME WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT SOME BASIC MATH AND PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS ALRIGHT SO AGAIN UM FOR THESE QUESTIONS JUST ASSUME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE MATHEMATICAL THEORIES SO PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION AND ALSO EXPLAIN IT LIKE YOU'RE TUTORING ME OK OK AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE ANSWER IS PLEASE TRY TO GUESS AND IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA JUST TELL ME THAT YOU WANT TO SKIP THE QUESTION ALRIGHT OK SO WE'RE GOING TO START OFF JUST BY CALIBRATING THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES AGAIN OK {SL} SO ON THE LEFT AND ON THE RIGHT ARE SETS ON THE LEFT WHAT DO THE U UPSIDE-DOWN U AND X SYMBOLS MEAN {SL} MM {SL} SO {SL} SO THE U I THINK THAT MEANS LIKE A UNION {SL} BASICALLY UH YOU TAKE ALL {SL} YOU TAKE ALL THE NUMBERS OF {SL} A AND {SL} AND {SL} AND LIKE YOU ADD ALL THE THE NUMBERS THAT ARE IN B LIKE {SL} ADD ONTO THE LIST OF NUMBERS THAT ARE IN A TO MAKE ONE LIKE LONGER LIST OF NUMBERS OK AND {SL} THE UP- THE UPSIDE-DOWN {SL} ONE I THINK IS UH INTERSECTION WHICH BASIC- BASICALLY MEANS LIKE {SL} LIKE UH IT'S A LIST OF N- NUM- NUMBERS THAT THE TWO SETS HAVE IN COMMON {SL} AND THE X I THINK {SL} UH {SL} IT'S LIKE {SL} UH {SL} YOU MULTIPLY EACH NUMBER IN THE FIRST SET {SL} BY LIKE EACH NUMBER IN THE SECOND SET {SL} IF I'M REMEMBERING CORRECTLY {SL} OK SO GIVEN THE SETS ON THE RIGHT WHAT SETS WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE LEFT {SL} OK SO {SL} SO I GUESS LIKE A UNION OF A AND B {SL} WOULD BE MM JUST ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT {SL} AND THE INTERSECTION OF B AND C WOULD BE {SL} UH JUST SIX SEVEN EIGHT {SL} AND THE INTERSECTION OF {SL} A AND C WOULD JUST BE COMPLETELY EMPTY SET {SL} UM {SL} THEN THE {SL} A TIMES D I THINK {SL} I THINK THAT'S LIKE {SL} I THINK THAT'D BE LIKE A MATRIX SO IT'D BE LIKE LIKE MULTIPLE ROWS AND NUMBERS SO {SL} LET ME THINK MHM {SL} UH {SL} WANNA WANNA SAY THE {SL} THE FIRST WANNA SAY THE FIRST ROW WOULD BE {SL} X TWO X THREE X AND THE SECOND ROW WOULD BE Y TWO Y THREE Y OK GREAT {SL} WHAT IS THE ROOT NODE {SL} UH THE ROOT NODE IS THE FIFTY {SL} OK WHAT IS THE PARENT NODE OF NINETEEN {SL} UH TWENTY THREE {SL} OK WHAT ARE THE CHILD NODES OF SEVENTY TWO {SL} FIFTY FOUR SEVENTY SIX AND SIXTY SEVEN {SL} AND WHAT ARE THE SIBLING NODES OF TWELVE {SL} DID YOU SAY SIBLING NODES MHM UM I GUESS {SL} TWENTY THREE UH {SL} MAYBE FIFTY FOUR AND SEVENTY SIX {SL} OK GREAT {SL} WHAT SPECIAL TYPE OF FUNCTION IS THIS {SL} UM IT'S A A RECURSIVE FUNCTION OK AND WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} UM {SL} MM {SL} JUST GOING BY THE NAME OF THE METHOD UM {SL} I'M ASSUMING IT UH {SL} IT RETURNS THE GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR BETWEEN X AND Y {SL} OK GREAT {SL} WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} UH LOOKS LIKE {SL} LIKE IT GOES THROUGH A LIST OF {SL} UM WHAT NUMBERS OR OBJECTS OR SOME SOMETHING AND IT UH IT IT SORTS THEM INTO ASCENDING ORDER {SL} AND WHAT IS THE FORMAL NAME FOR THIS TYPE OF FUNCTION {SL} MM I KNOW THERE'S LIKE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT NAMES FOR LIKE DIFFERENT SORTING ALGORITHMS BUT I CAN'T I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS CALLED OK THAT'S OK WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT ONE {SL} EXPLAIN EACH OF THE SYMBOLS ON THE LEFT {SL} HM {SL} I MEAN UH THEY THEY LOOK {SL} THEY LOOK VAGUELY FAMILIAR BUT {SL} IT'S {SL} BUT I DUNNO I THINK IT'S BEEN {SL} LIKE A WHILE SINCE I'VE {SL} DONE ANYTHING WITH THEM I DON'T REMEMBER OK THAT'S ALRIGHT UM IF YOU'RE ABLE TO USING THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE RIGHT COULD YOU CREATE AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE DEFINING THE VARIABLES HOWEVER YOU WANT {SL} YEAH I DUNNO {SL} OK YEAH THAT'S GREAT TOTALLY FINE {SL} OK ON A WEBSITE THIS WOULD PRODUCE WHAT DOES EXAMPLE A B AND C LOOK LIKE {SL} HM {SL} SO {SL} UH {SL} SO EXAMPLE A WOULD MAKE UH LIKE THE BACKGROUND PINK AND THINK THE I THINK THE ACTUAL TEXT WOULD BE LIKE THE UPPER LEFT AND UH WOULD BE RED {SL} AND {SL} EXAMPLE B WOULD BE CENTERED AND {SL} UH IT'D BE WRITTEN IN BLUE {SL} AND {SL} EXAMPLE C WOULD {SL} I GUESS WOULD MAKE THE BACKGROUND COLOR YELLOW AND {SL} I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE IT WOULD BE WRITTEN BUT {SL} I JUST KNOW THAT I MEAN THE TEXT WOULD BE GREEN OK {SL} ALRIGHT GREAT {SL} DESCRIBE TO ME USING THE PICTURE WHAT A LOOP IS {SL} HM {SL} UH {SL} LOOKS LIKE ALL THESE POINTS EXCEPT FOR THE ZERO ARE CONNECTED TO ANOTHER POINT {SL} SO {SL} SO I SO I THINK I THINK THE LOOP WOULD WOULD BE {NS} UM {SL} UM {SL} I GUESS {NS} I GUESS IT'S KINDA EASIER TO JUST LIKE SEE AN EXAMPLE SO I THINK THE I THINK THE LOOP WOULD BE {NS} {SL} UH LIKE HOW THE THE THREE CONNECTS TO THE TWO WHICH CONNECTS TO THE FIVE THEN THAT GOES BACK TO THE THREE {SL} AND MAKES THAT LIKE TRIANGLE {SL} SO {SL} OK HOW MANY LOOPS ARE THERE IN THIS PICTURE {SL} UM {SL} THREE OR FOUR DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE FIVE CONNECTING TO ITSELF COUNTS AS A LOOP {SL} OK {SL} AND WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THE ZERO VERTEX {SL} HM {SL} HM I I'VE JUST COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN ALL LIKE MOST OF THIS STUFF SO I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THE TERM IS SURE THAT'S OK {SL} DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS HERE {SL} UH {SL} SO IT'S JUST {SL} JUST UM CODE FOR LIKE AN {SL} LIKE AN ONLINE {SL} UH BREAKFAST MENU AT SOME RESTAURANT {SL} AND IT HAS INFORMATION ON {SL} LIKE TWO ON TWO OF THE ITEMS {SL} BELGIAN WAFFLES AND STRAWBERRY BELGIAN WAFFLES {SL} OK {SL} WHAT TYPE OF CODING IS THIS {SL} UM {SL} I WANNA SAY H T M L CAUSE IT LOOKS MORE LIKE THAT THAN ANYTHING ELSE I'VE SEEN BUT I MEAN I'M NOT POSITIVE OK GREAT AND WHAT'S A BENEFIT OF CODING INFORMATION THIS WAY {SL} UM IT'S JUST {SL} LIKE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AND AND JUST EASILY UNDERSTAND WHAT LIKE WHAT EACH THING IS SUPPOSED IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE YOU KNOW IN THE LIKE IN CONTEXT OF {SL} UM {SL} HM {SL} I MEAN I GUESS IT JUST TO MAKE IT SO PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT IT AND YOU KNOW KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT BASICALLY MHM OK THAT MAKES SENSE {SL} WHAT KIND OF GRAPH IS THIS {SL} YEAH I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THESE ARE CALLED OK THAT'S OK WHAT'S THE SHORTEST PATH FROM SEVEN TO TWO {SL} HM {SL} UH THE SHORTEST PATH I THINK {SL} LIKE IF THE NUMBERS DON'T MEAN ANYTHING {SL} THEN I THINK THE SHORTEST PATH WOULD BE UH LIKE EIGHT TO SIX TO TWO BUT {SL} LIKE IF THE NUMBERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE LIKE WEIGHTS FOR EACH PATH THEN {SL} YEAH {SL} WAIT ACTUALLY ACTUALLY NO THAT {SL} UH I I MISREAD THE ARROW IT LOOKS LIKE EIGHT TO SIX TO TWO MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE ONLY PATH {SL} OK GREAT WHAT IS A CYCLE ALSO CALLED A ROUTE OR A TOUR {SL} SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THAT SURE WHAT IS A CYCLE AND IT'S ALSO SOMETIMES CALLED A ROUTE OR A TOUR {SL} HM {SL} HM {SL} I WANNA SAY IT'S LIKE A PATH THAT GOES LIKE GOES THROUGH EACH NUMBER ONCE AND THEN ENDS BACK WHERE IT STARTED OK ALRIGHT AND HOW MANY CYCLES ARE IN THIS GRAPH {SL} HM {SL} HM {SL} IF WHAT I'M THINKING OF AS A CYCLE IS RIGHT THEN I CAN'T FIND ANY {SL} I MEAN BUT {SL} I MEAN IF I IF I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT A CYCLE IS THEN {SL} THEN YOU KNOW I DUNNO OK THAT'S OK {SL} THIS IS A LIST OF SOME BIG-O NOTATIONS FOR ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY SO GIVING NAMES AND EXAMPLES WHERE YOU CAN DESCRIBE TO ME THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPLEXITIES {SL} HM {SL} OK SO {SL} OK SO UH O ONE BASICALLY MEANS THAT {SL} UH THAT THE FUNCTION {SL} UH IT WORKS AT THE SAME SPEED NO MATTER UH HOW MUCH DATA YOU HAVE TO LOOK THROUGH {SL} UH {SL} O O N IS WHEN {SL} UM {SL} I THINK I THINK I THINK IT'S EASIER TO LIKE GIVE EXAMPLES FOR THESE RATHER THAN OK TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT LIKE IT'S LIKE O N WOULD WOULD BE LIKE UH {SL} WOULD BE LIKE UH {SL} LOOK- UH LOOKING THROUGH AN ENTIRE ARRAY TO FIND A CERTAIN UH ELEMENT IN IT {SL} OK UH {SL} O O N WITH THE EXCLAMATION MARK I DON'T {SL} I DON'T REMEMBER {SL} O LOG N I DON'T REMEMBER EITHER {SL} UH O N SQUARED WOULD BE LIKE UH {SL} IT'D BE LIKE {SL} UH {SL} UH LOOPING THROUGH AN ARRAY {SL} LIKE {SL} IT'S IT'S LIKE LOOPING THROUGH AN ARRAY {SL} LIKE WITH {SL} WHEN YOU LOOK AT LIKE EACH ELEMENT IN A DIFFERENT ARRAY {SL} I GUESS {SL} I DUNNO {SL} YEAH OK MAKES SENSE {SL} OK UM WHICH TYPE OF COMPLEXITY IS BEST AND WHY {SL} UH O O ONE IS THE BEST BECAUSE IT'S {SL} IT'S {SL} I MEAN IT'S IT'S JUST THE THE FASTEST AND LIKE {SL} IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW A MILLION PIECES OF DATA TO LOOK AT AND THAT AND THE FUNCTION {SL} UH THE COMPLEXITY OF O ONE WOULD ALWAYS RUN AT THE SAME SPEED {SL} OK ALRIGHT GREAT {SL} WHAT IS A VERTEX AND HOW MANY VERTICES ARE THERE {SL} OK SO {SL} SO A VERTEX IS YOU KNOW EACH NUMBER POINT IN THE PICTURE SO THERE'S EIGHT OF THEM OK WHAT IS AN EDGE AND HOW MANY EDGES ARE THERE {SL} HM {SL} TH- EDGES ARE THE LINES CONNECTING UH THE VERTICES SO THERE'S {SL} UH THERE'S TWELVE EDGES OK {SL} UM HOW LONG IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM ONE TO SIX {SL} CAN'T REMEMBER IF THERE'S SOME LIKE CERTAIN NOTATION FOR IT OR SOMETHING BUT {SL} FOR FOR LIKE IF YOU'RE GOING FROM ONE TO SIX YOU A- UH {SL} YOU HAVE TO GO TO LIKE AT LEAST ONE OTHER {SL} VERTEX IN BETWEEN THE TWO OK GREAT AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT THREE AND TWO ARE ADJACENT {SL} I MEAN {SL} THEY HAVE UH THEY HAVE AN EDGE UH LIKE LIKE THEY'RE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER OK GREAT UM SO THAT'S IT THAT'S THE LAST QUESTION OK UM WE JUST NEED TO ONE LAST TIME WE NEED TO CALIBRATE THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES AGAIN ALRIGHT AND THEN UM WE'LL GO FROM THERE {SL} OK ALL SET UM SO YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE OFF THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES AND THE MIC {SL}
