THE FIRST SESSION DID AND THERE ARE TWO TASKS THAT WE'LL BE DOING TODAY SO FIRST I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A SERIES OF IMAGES AND FOR EACH IMAGE I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I'M GOING TO ASK SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MIGHT BE EASY OR HARD SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MIGHT SEEM SILLY UM BUT AGAIN JUST DO YOUR BEST TO ANSWER UM AND TRY TO GUESS IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER FOR SURE AND AGAIN IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE ANSWER IS JUST TELL ME THAT YOU WANT TO SKIP THE QUESTION OK OK AND UH WE WILL GET STARTED AND SORRY I DO JUST WANT TO MENTION THERE ARE NO RIGHT OR WRONG QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF THE IMAGE QUESTIONS EITHER SO WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED JUST BY CALIBRATING THE EYE TRACKER AGAIN SO IF YOU COULD JUST FOLLOW THE BLACK EXES AS THEY APPEAR {SL} THE SCREEN LOOKS PRETTY DIFFERENT TODAY DOES IT YEAH IT'S A MUCH DARKER GREY INSTEAD OF THE WHITE FROM LAST TIME HUH SHOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME {SL} MM I REMEMBER IT BEING WHITE YESTERDAY THIS IS LIKE {SL} G- VERY GREY HM WELL SHOULD BE ALRIGHT THOUGH {SL} SHOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME {SL} OK HOW LONG HAS THE UNEXPECTED VISITOR BEEN AWAY {SL} UM HM {SL} WELL JUDGING FROM THE GIRL'S F- JUDGING FROM SOME OF THE EXPRESSIONS UM {SL} I CAN'T REALLY SAY I'D I'D GUESS AROUND A WEEK CAUSE THEY DON'T LOOK VERY SOME OF THEM DON'T LOOK VERY HAPPY TO SEE HIM {SL} SO IT SOUNDS LIKE UH IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A POSITIVE VISIT WHICH SUGGESTS SH- THAT MAY HAVE BEEN UH NOT TOO LONG BEFOREHAND {SL} I'M GOING MAINLY BY THE FACE OF THE GIRL ON THE DESK AND THE PERSON BY THE PIANO THE UH {SL} GUY ON THE RIGHT LOOKS UH PRETTY LOOKS LIKE HE MIGHT BE HAPPY BUT {SL} OK HOW RICH IS THE FAMILY {SL} UH WELL THEY HAVE A PIANO BUT UM {SL} I'M NOT VERY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TIME PERIOD SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW I DON'T HAVE A VERY GOOD INDICATOR OF UH OF IT I MEAN THE HOUSE LOOKS NICE AL- ENOUGH I'D GUESS THEY'RE ABOVE THE POVERTY LINE ALTHOUGH BEING UH UNHAPPY TO SEE SOMEBODY COMING WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME FINANCIAL ISSUES MHM {SL} OK WHAT SEASON IS IT {SL} UM {SL} THEY'RE UH THEY'RE WEARING THICK CLOTHES BUT IT'S THE KIND OF THAT TIME PERIOD WHERE THEY REALLY WORE THAT A LOT UM {SL} I WOULD GUESS EITHER FALL OR EARLY SPRING POSSIBLY VERY EARLY OR LATE WINTER MHM I'D GUESS IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND WHEN THE SEASONS ARE CHANGING AND NOT AT THEIR MOST EXTREME ON EITHER FRONT OK {SL} GREAT AND HOW DO THE CHILDREN FEEL ABOUT THE VISITOR WELL AS I SAID THE GIRL DOESN'T LOOK THAT HAPPY ALTHOUGH THAT MIGHT JUST BE THE CONTRAST OF THE SCREEN AND THE KID LOOKS UH {SL} M- HE LOOKS UH UH HAPPY OR SURPRISED THE BOY ON THE RIGHT {SL} OK GREAT WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT ONE {SL} IS THE DOCTOR GIVING GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS {SL} UM {SL} DOESN'T NECESSARILY LOOK LIKE HE'S GIVING GOOD NEWS I MEAN HE HAS A UH HE HAS WHAT DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE AN X-RAY UM WHICH NORMALLY IS NOT SHOWN AT TIMES OF GOOD NEWS UH {SL} NEITHER NO- NEITHER OF THE EXPRESSIONS SEEM VERY POSITIVE UM {SL} I MEAN THE MAN'S FACE LOOKS STERN THE WOMAN'S FACE LOOKS KIND OF EITHER WORRYING OR ARE YOU SERIOUS WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY I UM OF COURSE I HAVE KIND OF HAVE ASPERGER'S SO I'M NOT THE BEST WITH GETTING MOOD OUT OF IT BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SEEM GOOD NEWS BOTH FROM WHAT HE'S HOLDING AND THEIR EXPRESSIONS I MEAN FOR ALL I KNOW IT COULD BE NOTHING'S WRONG BUT WE- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR THE VISIT ANYWAYS {SL} OK GREAT HOW THE TWO PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT FEEL {SL} UM {SL} LOOKS KIND OF LIKE THEY'RE UNSURE I GUESS LIKE THEY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION MHM I MEAN THEY ARE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER FOR ONE UM ONE OF THEM LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT MHM OK GREAT WHAT IS THE PROFESSION OF THE MAN ON THE LEFT UM I WOULD GUESS THAT HE'S PROBABLY CAUSE HE DOES APPEAR TO BE HOLDING AN X-RAY UM A SPECIALIST ON UH {SL} HE'S PROBABLY A DOCTOR UM SO HE'S VERY LIKELY EITHER THE PERSON WHO TAKES THE X-RAYS OR UM I'M AWARE THAT SOMETIMES UH SOMEBODY'LL TAKE THE X-RAY AND YOU'LL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN TO GET IT LOOKED AT {SL} OK AND WHERE IS THIS CONVERSATION TAKING PLACE UH IT LOOKS LIKE AN OFFICE BUT IT DOESN'T I HAVEN'T BEEN IN VERY MANY PUBLIC OFFICES SO THIS LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A SPECIALIST AS OPPOSED TO A HOSPITAL WHICH WOULD ALSO BE KIND OF SUGGESTED BY THE CLIPBOARD UH AND THE TABLE MHM THE CLIPBOARD TABLE AND THE WALLPAPER WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT'S A PRIVATE OFFICE AS OPPOSED TO A PUBLIC ONE OK ALRIGHT GREAT {SL} WHAT MIGHT THIS PERSON BE TRYING TO DO {SL} PROGRAM {SL} UH BUT UH IT DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE UH {SL} TRYING TO DO SOMETHING WHERE THE RESULTS AREN'T WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTING AND THEY'RE NOT SURE WHAT HOW TO GET THE RIGHT ONES MHM {SL} OK I'VE DEFINITELY FELT THIS WAY WHILE PROGRAMMING BEFORE ALTHOUGH THE PRINTER WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SUGGEST PROGRAMMING {SL} OK WHY IS THIS PERSON FRUSTRATED {SL} UH IT IT THE ALL THE PAPERS WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY'VE BEEN TRYING AND TRYING SOMETHING AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE ANSWER THEY WANT MHM ALTHOUGH I GUESS THAT'S KIND OF ME JUST DESCRIBING WHAT FRUSTRATED IS BUT UM THEY DEFINITELY SEEM LIKE THEY'VE BEEN TRYING FOR A LONG TIME POSSIBLY WITH A DEADLINE THE SMOKE COMING FROM THE COMPUTER SUGGESTS THAT THE COMPUTER MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY BROKEN AT AN INOPPORTUNE TIME MHM {SL} OK {SL} OK GREAT AND WHAT EQUIPMENT IS HE USING UM HE'S USING AN OLDER COMPUTER IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL IF THAT'S A TYPEWRITER OR A PRINTER IT'S PROBABLY A PRINTER I'D GUESS UM {SL} IT'S A WEIRD LOOKING PRINTER THOUGH {SL} UH {SL} YEAH HE'S IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S DEFINITELY USING A PC THOUGH NOT A MAC UM {SL} J- JUST FROM THE SHAPE AND GENERAL BUILD OF IT OF COURSE UH AND THE TIME PERIOD WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT A LINUX BASED OPERATING SYSTEM {SL} OK WHAT WILL HE DO NEXT UM HE MIGHT SEEK HELP UH IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S AT THE END OF HIS ROPE AND MIGHT BREAK SOMETHING SOON {SL} UH HE MIGHT HAVE TO SEE A DOCTOR ABOUT HIS HAIR PULLING HABIT {SL} UH {SL} YEAH N- WHEN I FEEL LIKE THIS I TYPICALLY GET HELP UM {SL} J- JUST SEE SOMEBODY ELSE WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT SOMETHING UH OR I MIGHT KEEP TRYING OR HE MIGHT EVEN QUIT DIFFERENT PEOPLE REACT TO STRESS VERY DIFFERENTLY {SL} OK GREAT GO TO THE NEXT ONE {SL} {BR} {SL} WHY IS THIS PICTURE FUNNY UM {SL} WELL IT'S BASICALLY USING THE COMMONLY KNOWN UH CONCEPT OF CR- UH CROP CIRCLES WITH A VERY SIMPLE PURPOSE CAUSE PART OF THE IDEA BEHIND UH THE MYSTERY OF CROP CIRCLES IS OF COURSE A WHETHER THEY WERE MADE JUST AS HOAXES AND B UH UM WHETHER UH THEY SERVE A PURPOSE WHETHER THEY'RE FOR US OR FOR THE ALIENS TO DECIPHER SOMETHING MHM OR WHETHER THEY'RE EVEN IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY BY ALIENS WHETHER IT'S JUST ALIENS BEING DICKS AND PLAYING PRANKS I'VE SEEN THAT INTERPRETATION SOMETIMES MHM {SL} OK WHAT DOES THE CROP CIRCLE LOOK LIKE UH TIC TAC TOE BOARD WHERE X WON AS USUAL MHM AND WHERE ARE THE TWO GREEN MEN FROM {SL} UM {SL} OUT- EITHER OUTER SPACE OR ROSWELL NEW MEXICO BECAUSE THEY DO SEEM UH TO BE GREYS I'D I'D SAY ALTHOUGH A BIT THEY'RE A BIT FAT FOR A GREY UM {SL} BUT YEAH {SL} OK GREAT AND WHY IS THE MAN ON THE LEFT POINTING AND SMILING {SL} UM {SL} HE APPEARS TO I'D GUESS HE'S PROBABLY POINTING AT THE CROP CIRCLE UM {SL} THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE ACTUALLY MADE IT AND BE MAKING FUN OF WHOEVER DID MAKE IT UH BUT {SL} I GUESS HE FINDS IT HUMOROUS AS WELL {SL} OK ALRIGHT {SL} WHY IS THE WOMAN THE SECOND FROM THE RIGHT LOOKING AT THE MAN {SL} UM CAUSE SHE APPARENTLY HAS TO PAY HIM {SL} OK WH- AND SHE ALSO DOESN'T WANT HIM TO NOTICE THE PERSON WHO APPEARS TO BE PICKING HIS POCKET I'D GUESS {SL} OK WHAT ACTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE {SL} THE WOMAN IS UH PAYING THE MAN MONEY WHILE SOMEBODY ELSE IS PICKING HIS POCKET {SL} THE PERSON PICKING HIS POCKET IS WEARING UH AN OUTFIT THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT SHE MIGHT BE FROM A DIFFERENT CULTURE FROM THE MAN WHO'S HAVING HIS POCKET PICKED {SL} ER I CAN'T TELL IF THAT'S UH N- WELL NO I GUESS THAT IS PROBABLY A WOMAN PICKING HIS POCKET BUT WITH SIMPLY ANOTHER MAN OR EVEN A WOMAN NEXT TO HIM I DON'T KNOW {SL} UM BUT {SL} AH DAMN THE SCREEN DARKNESS MAKES IT HARD TO TELL BUT UH ONE OF THE WOMAN IS FIDDLING WITH THE MAN'S I CAN'T TELL IF THAT'S A CHAIN OR A TASSEL HA SHE MIGHT EVEN BE TAKING IT UM GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF THE PICTURE MHM BUT UH THE MAN IS CERTAINLY TAKING SOME MONEY WHILE LOSING A LOT MORE {SL} OK {SL} AND WHAT ARE THE WOMAN DOING {SL} UH ONE OF THEM'S GIVING HIM SOME MONEY UH QUITE POSSIBLY REGRETFULLY OR SHE MIGHT JUST BE UH WORRI- UH WORRIED THAT HE'LL CATCH THE PEOPLE PICKING HIS POCKET WHILE OTHERS ARE LIKE I SAID PICKING HIS POCKET AND SCREWING WITH HIS TASSEL MHM {SL} OK AND WHAT TIME PERIOD IS THIS PICTURE DEPICTING I'M NOT VERY I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT TIME- THE NAMES OF TIME PERIODS BUT THIS DEFINITELY LOOKS UH LIKE IT WOULD BE {SL} I JUST SAY VICTORIAN ON INSTINCT UH BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE ONLY NAMES FOR THEM I KNOW {LS} OK THAT'S ALRIGHT {SL} ALRIGHT WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT ONE {SL} THAT'S AN INTERESTING STOCK IMAGE {SL} WHERE IS THIS TAKING PLACE UH AN OFFICE {SL} OK AND HOW DOES THIS PERSON FEEL {SL} UM I'D SAY ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED {SL} MHM THAT'S AN INTERESTING HAMMER TO BE USING {SL} OK AND WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED {SL} UH {SL} I DON'T KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE SPILLED OR HE'S BEEN HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE COMPUTER AND IDEAS ON A NOTEBOOK {SL} UH THE REASON I SAY SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE SPILLED IS CAUSE OF THAT BROWN THING I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S A SHADOW OR IF THE SCREEN'S CONTRAST IS A BIT WEIRD {SL} UM {SL} BUT HE'S OBVIOUSLY HAVING SOME KIND OF ISSUE WELL OF COURSE HE WOULDN'T REALLY BE ANG- UPSET OTHERWISE {SL} BUT {SL} {NS} YEAH {SL} OK AND WHAT COLOR IS HIS TIE {SL} UM {SL} I'D SAY IT'S UH RED WITH YELLOW STRIPES {SL} OK GREAT {SL} HOW DOES THE CAR FEEL UH IT LOOKS PRETTY HAPPY OK {SL} AND WHY MIGHT THE CAR FEEL THIS WAY CAUSE IT'S BEEN WASHED AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S WANTS TO BE WASHED ACCORDING TO THE THING ON IT'S UH LICENSE PLATE MHM {SL} OK AND WHAT TYPE OF CAR IS THIS UH OH GOD I SUCK AT CAR NAMES I WANT TO GIVE A REALLY SP- PRECISE ANSWER BUT UH AN ANTHROPOMORPHIZED ONE OK UH {SL} IT DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE UH IT'S NOT A MINI VAN IT LOOKS LIKE A FOUR- UH A CAR THAT'LL SEAT FOUR PEOPLE UM EVEN AN OLD STATION WAGON POSSIBLY A BEETLE {SL} BUT I'M NOT SURE {SL} OK THAT'S ALRIGHT YOU NEVER ACTUALLY SEE VOLKSWAGENS ON THE ROAD ANYMORE MM PUNCH BUGGIES MM {SL} OK AND WHAT COLOR IS THE CAR UM IT LOOKS YELLOW WITH SOME ORANGE SHADING {SL} OK GREAT {SL} WHERE ARE THEY {SL} UH AT AN ARCADE OR POSSIBLY A MOVIE THEATRE'S ARCADE {NS} BUT THE LIGHTING WOULD SUGGEST A NORMAL ARCADE {SL} OK AND WHAT IS THEIR RELATIONSHIP UM THEY MIGHT BE BROTHER AND SISTER BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND UH THERE'S ANY OF A VARIETY OF SIT- OF RELATIONSHIPS THEY COULD HAVE UH IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE TOGETHER THEY'RE PROBABLY TOGETHER SPECIFICALLY TO HAVE FUN WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE IN SOME KIND OF CLOSE RELATIONSHIP ALTHOUGH THEY COULD JUST BE NORMAL FRIENDS GOING OUT TO HAVE FUN MHM {SL} SURE AND WHAT KIND OF GAME ARE THEY PLAYING UH IT DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE A RACING GAME {SL} OK GREAT AND HOW OFTEN DO THEY PLAY VIDEO GAMES {SL} UM {SL} THEY M- PROBABLY DON'T PLAY THEM T- I'D GUESS THEY DON'T PLAY THEM TOO OFTEN BUT THEY DO ENJOY PLAYING THEM ONCE IN A WHILE BECAUSE THEY DO SEEM TO BE HAVING A LOT OF FUN PLAYING THIS ONE AND THIS DOES SEEM TO BE ONE THAT'S KIND OF NEW TO AT LEAST ONE OF THEM {SL} UH THE GUY SEEMS PRETTY IMPRESSED OR LIKE HE OR LIKE HE MIGHT BE USED TO IT AND HAVING AND ENJOYING SHOWING HER OR SHE MIGHT BE ENJOYING SHOWING HIM MHM OK {SL} OK {SL} GREAT {SL} WHY IS THE DOG LOOKING AT THE BOY {SL} UH CAUSE THE BOY IS LOOKING AT THE DOG QUITE POSSIBLY {SL} I DO REMEMBER THAT DOGS ARE SUPPOSEDLY ONE OF THE FEW P- UH CHARACTERS ER NOT CHARACTERS UH ANIMALS CAPABLE OF NOTING NOTICING EYE AND HAND SIGNALS MM LIKE APPARENTLY EVEN MONKEYS WON'T KNOW IT IF YOU POINT TO SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT IT BUT DOGS WILL MM {SL} ALSO I REMEMBER HEARING THAT DOGS ARE KIND OF BIG ON EYE CONTACT {SL} OK WHAT HAVE THE BOY AND DOG BEEN DOING BEFORE THIS MOMENT {SL} UM I'D GUESS THAT THEY WERE ON THE STREET MAYBE FOR A WALK I'M TH- I'M THINKING OF I THINK WAS IT THE DOG OF FLANDERS I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY READ THAT STORY HM UM {SL} I HAVE NO REAL WAY TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING ALTHOUGH THE BOY'S PANTS DON'T LOOK THAT NEW {SL} OK AND HOW MUCH DOES THE DOG WEIGH {SL} UM {SL} I WANNA SAY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY TO FIFTY POUNDS {SL} MM {SL} OK {SL} GREAT AND HOW OLD IS THE BOY I'D GUESS HE'S IN HIS TEENS {SL} MAYBE {SL} FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN {SL} OK GREAT {SL} IS THAT X K C D YEP {SL} WHAT ARE THEY DROPPING OFF THE LEDGE UH IT'S AN EGG {SL} MHM OK AND HOW DO THE PEOPLE FEEL UM PRETTY SURPRISED {SL} OK WHY WOULD THE PEOPLE BE SURPRISED BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING AN EXPERIMENT UH THAT'S MEANT TO UH {SL} THE IDEA IS THAT YOU TRY AND DROP THE EGG OFF THE CLIFF AND MAKE IT NOT BREAK WHEN IT LANDS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IN THE MIDDLE A BIRD COMES OUT MHM SO THEY MIGHT ALSO BE FEELING A BIT DISAPPOINTED UH BECAUSE THEY CAN'T REALLY TEST THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW IF IT WORKED BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY A LOT MORE SURPRISED BECAUSE UM {SL} IT YOU DON'T REALLY SEE THAT EVERY DAY MHM {SL} OK AND IS IT REALISTIC FOR AN EGG TO HATCH WHILE DROPPING UM NO ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT TYPICALLY THOSE THINGS WOULD ALL BE CONNECTED TO THE EGG AND IT'S EVEN LESS TYPICAL FOR THE BIRD TO IMMEDIATE FLY UPON HATCHING {SL} OK {SL} WHY IS THERE MONEY ON THE TABLE UH THEY APPEAR TO BE GAMBLING {SL} AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE {SL} UH {SL} HOW IS SHE HOLDING THE FLASK UM WELL AS I SAID THEY ARE UH APPARENTLY GAMBLING ONE OF THEM IS CHEATING UM HAVING CARDS TUCKED IN THE INTO THE BACK OF HER SASH {SL} UH LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WEIRD SHE HAS TWO ACES OF DIAMONDS TUCKED THERE {SL} UM WHICH DOESN'T REALLY MAKE MUCH SENSE {SL} ER IS WAIT IS THAT A SHE OR A HE {SL} I REALLY CAN'T TELL WITH SOME OF THESE PERIOD PIECES BUT ONE OF THEM IS CHEATING {SL} UH {SL} HAVING TROUBLE TELLING WHERE SOME OF THEM ARE LOOKING {SL} UH WELL YES THEY ARE GAMBLING ONE OF THEM IS CHEATING {SL} AND ONE OF THEM SEEMS TO BE ASKING FOR SOMETHING UH THE ONE WITH THE BIG RED HAT APPEARS TO BE ASKING FOR SOMETHING ALTHOUGH I CAN'T TELL IF SHE'S ASKING FOR SOMETHING OR POINTING {SL} BUT WHEN I SEE THIS IT'S IT FEELS MORE LIKE UH GESTURE FOR ASKING THAN FOR UH GETTING {SL} WOULD KIND OF HELP IF I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT CARD GAME THEY WERE PLAYING TOO {SL} OK WHO KNOWS THAT THE MAN HAS CARDS BEHIND HIS BACK {SL} UM WELL WE DO FOR ONE THE MAN OBVIOUSLY DOES UM {SL} THE MAN IN THE I C- IT I CAN'T TELL IF THE WOMAN IN THE UH YELLOW HEAD DRESS IS LOOKING AT THE VIEWER OR THE MAN AND I CAN'T TELL IF THE WOMAN IN THE RED HEAD DRESS IS LOOKING AT THE MAN {SL} OR THE WOMAN IN THE YELLOW HEAD DRESS UM {SL} ACK {SL} BUT I WOULD S- I WOULD GUESS THAT {SL} THE WOMAN IN THE R- UH RED HEAD DRESS SEEMS A BIT SUSPICIOUS SHE HAS A RATHER SERIOUS EXPRESSION ON HER FACE OR M- MORE MAYBE MORE QUESTIONING {SL} OK AND HOW RICH IS EACH PERSON IN THIS PICTURE {SL} UH THE YOU MEAN AT THE MOMENT OR IN GENERAL CAUSE THE PERSON ON THE RIGHT IS WEARING A VERY UH {SL} {NS} {SL} UH EMBROIDERED OUTFIT BUT THAT COULD ALSO BE BECAUSE THEY'RE FROM A DIFFERENT CULTURE AS THEY DO SEEM TO BE FROM A DIFFERENT ETHNICITY UM {SL} THE MAN ON THE RIGHT AND THE OR OR MAYBE WOMAN I GUESS I DON'T KNOW {SL} AND THE WOMAN WITH THE RED HEAD DRESS DEFINITELY APPEAR TO BE THE MOST WEALTHY UH IN TERMS O- O- SOLELY OF OUT- FITS HOWEVER THE WOMAN WITH THE YELLOW HEAD DRESS APPEARS TO BE HOLDING A BIG BAG OF MONEY ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT JUST BE AN EMPLOYEE AT THE LOCATION THEY'RE AT SEEING AS SHE DOES APPEAR TO BE GIVING THE GLASS OF WINE {SL} OK GREAT WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT ONE AC- OH SORRY {SL} ACTUALLY IT IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE UH MAN AT THE TABLE IS THE DEALER AND ISN'T ACTUALLY UH CHEATING I I THINK SO IT COULD BE THAT {SL} UH HE'S DEALING CARDS AND HE'S GIVING CERTAIN CARDS TO ONE PERSON OVER THE OTHER {SL} CAUSE HE DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE ANY MONEY IN FRONT OF HIM {SL} BUT I'M NOT POSITIVE ABOUT THAT {SL} AND YEAH OK GREAT GREAT WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT ONE {SL} WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE {SL} I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHAT HIS NAME COULD BE EGG- EGG- EGG ER VO {SL} I I DON'T KNOW UM {SL} BUT THE UH {SL} SEEING ONCE AGAIN THERE IS A UH WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN X-RAY UM {SL} THE MAN IS TALKING WITH E- EITHER HIS WIFE OR HIS DAUGHTER I'M GOING TO GUESS HIS DAUGHTER UM ABOUT WHAT IS ON IT UH {SL} OR HE MIGHT BE ASKING TH- THE MAN HOLDING THE X-RAY QUESTIONS {SL} UM {SL} IT'S NOT EXACTLY EASY TO KNOW {SL} UM BECAUSE HE IS OLDER THEY'RE PROBABLY THERE FOR HIM {SL} UM ALTHOUGH THAT DOES LOOK LIKE A MILITARY OUTFIT WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT MIGHT BE UH FOR HER IF SHE WANTS TO JOIN OR IF FOR SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT EVEN BE NOT THERE UM BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE VISITING HIM AND ASKING WHAT'S GOING ON MHM CAUSE THEY'RE NOT IN VERY FORMAL ATTIRE SO THEY MIGHT BE VISITING UH SOMEBODY WHO IS IN THE ARMY OR THE MILITARY RATHER UH AND GOT INJURED AND BE- BEING SHOWN AN X-RAY ABOUT IT ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T LOOK TOO SOMBER SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL IN REGARDS TO THAT OK {SL} THAT'S GREAT WHAT IS THE PROFESSION OF THE MAN ON THE LEFT THE MAN ON THE LEFT APPEARS TO BE IN A MEDICAL FIELD DUE SOLELY TO THE FACT THAT HE'S HOLDING AN X-RAY AND HAS A STETHOSCOPE AROUND HIS NECK UH BUT HIS OUTFIT WOULD SUGGEST MILITARY RANK {SL} OK AND WHAT ARE THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS PICTURE OH THIS IS ONE I WENT OVER ALREADY HE APPEARS TO BE THE DOCTOR UM CAUSE HE'S HE'S HE BOTH HE AND THE OLD MAN ARE POINTING TO SOMETHING UM A- AS I SAID THE OLD THE OLDER MAN APPEARS TO BE THE FATHER OF THE GIRL ALTHOUGH THEY COULD BE MARRIED UM SHE DEFINITELY DOES APPEAR A LOT YOUNGER THOUGH {SL} OK GREAT AND APPROXIMATELY HOW OLD IS EACH PERSON UM OH I'M TERRIBLE WITH ESTIMATING AGE I'D I'D GUESS THAT UH THE WOMAN IS IN HER FORTIES THE DOCTOR IS IN HIS THIRTIES AND THE MAN IS IN HIS SEVENTIES OR EIGHTIES OK {SL} ALRIGHT WE'LL GO THE PERSON WHO'S X-RAY IT IS UH IS EITHER PROBABLY THE OLD MAN'S OR SOMEBODY UM IN HIS UH TWENTIES ALRIGHT {SL} GREAT THEN WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT ONE {SL} WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED OH I DON'T REMEMBER THIS SCENE IN THE MOVIE UM ALTHOUGH I'M GUESSING WOODY MIGHT HAVE JUST {SL} GOTTEN BACK UNLESS IT'S TOY STORY THREE I DON'T KNOW {SL} UH IS THIS FROM TOY STORY TWO OR THREE I'M NOT SURE {SL} UM BUT WOODY'S PROBABLY DONE SOMETHING GOOD UH IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT HE RETURNED BACK AFTER THE EVENTS OF TOY STORY TWO UM {SL} UH BUT SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED AND IT SEEMS TO BE LARGELY DUE TO WOODY {SL} ALRIGHT HOW DO THE TOYS FEEL UM THEY ALL SEEM TO FEEL PRETTY HAPPY EVEN MRS POTATO HEAD WHO'S UH MISSING AN EYE {SL} ALRIGHT HOW MANY FEMALE TOYS ARE IN THIS PICTURE {SL} UH {SL} I WOULD SAY ABOUT {SL} THREE THAT ARE UH DEFINITELY APPEAR TO BE FEMALE AND UH GOING SOLELY BY THEIR VOICE ACTORS UH T-REX THE DOG AND THE PIG ARE MALE AND THE {SL} UH ALIENS I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW OK {SL} SO I I WOULD SAY AT LEAST THREE {SL} ALRIGHT AND WHAT ARE THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE TOYS UH REX MR POTATO HEAD MRS POTATO HEAD UH RALPH UM {SL} WOODY UH BARBIE {SL} UM {SL} OH I CAN'T REMEMBER HER NAME I TH- I THINK THAT HORSES NAME MIGHT

VERY {SL} DEFINITELY NOT WHITE GREY AT FIRST IT STILL LOOKS A BIT DARKER BUT THAT'S WEIRD YEAH I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT WOULD BE {SL} I DON'T KNOW MAYBE MY EYES HAVE GOTTEN USED TO IT MAYBE {SL} BUT {LS} I HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKING MUCH AT THE TOP CORNER SO WE'LL START AGAIN {SL} OK SO JUST LIKE LAST TIME WE'LL TAKE A FIVE TO TEN MINUTE BREAK SO IF YOU COULD JUST TAKE OFF THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES AND
