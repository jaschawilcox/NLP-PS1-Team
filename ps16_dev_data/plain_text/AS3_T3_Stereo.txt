SOMETHING DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT WAS {SL} OK {SL} GOOD GOOD OK GREAT UM THEN WE'LL GET STARTED THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK IN TODAY NO PROBLEM AND AS THE CONSENT FORM INDICATED YOU'RE FREE TO PAUSE THE STUDY OR LEAVE THE STUDY AT ANY TIME JUST LET ME KNOW IF YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE OK OK ALRIGHT AND THIS IS THE SECOND AND LAST SESSION IT'LL TAKE ABOUT SIXTY TO NINETY MINUTES OK LIKE THE LAST ONE AND THERE SORRY OH IT'S OK CONTINUE YES CONTINUE OK NO JUST FEELS A LITTLE AWKWARD {SL} COMFORTABLE YEAH BETTER {SL} YEP I'M ALL SET OK GREAT UM SO THERE ARE TWO TASKS WE'LL BE DOING TODAY YEAH FIRST I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A SERIES OF IMAGES ALRIGHT AND FOR EACH IMAGE I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I'M GOING TO ASK OK SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MIGHT BE EASY OR DIFFICULT AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MIGHT SEEM SILLY OK THERE ARE NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS SO PLEASE JUST DO YOUR BEST TO GUESS THE ANSWER AND IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE ANSWER IS JUST TRY AND GUESS AND IF YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANY ANSWER JUST TELL ME THAT YOU WANT TO SKIP THE QUESTION OK OK YEP ALRIGHT SO WE WILL GET STARTED BY CALIBRATING THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES AGAIN SO IF YOU COULD JUST LOOK AT EACH OF THE BLACK EXES AS THEY APPEAR MHM {SL} HOW LONG HAS THE UNEXPECTED VISITOR BEEN AWAY {SL} I'M PROBABLY GOING TO ASSUME ON MY UH BASIS OF ASSUMPTION PROBABLY LIKE A GOOD TWO TO FIVE DAYS {SL} OK {SL} HOW RICH IS THE FAMILY THEY LOOK MIDDLE CLASS I MEAN I'D PROBABLY PROBABLY LIKE A STANDARD ENGLISH UH FAMILY I MEAN I MEAN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE LIKE QUEEN ELIZABETH RICH BUT YOU KNOW JUST MIDDLE CLASS PROBABLY LIKE YOU KNOW {BR} LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY {SL} WHAT SEASON IS IT IT LOOKS AS IF IT'S UH LATE {SL} UH LATE SUMMER EARLY AUTUMN LIKE SOMETIME IN SEPTEMBER OK GREAT AND HOW DO THE CHILDREN FEEL ABOUT THE VISITOR UM THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT BEFUDDLED BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THIS VISITOR IS A EITHER A COMPLETE STRANGER OR B {BR} JUST {SL} NEGLIGENT TO THEIR EXISTENCE SO AT WHICH AT WHICH POINT ONE COULD ASSUME THAT THE MAN WALKING IN IS {BR} PERHAPS THEIR FATHER OR THEIR UNCLE OR SOMEHOW RELATED OK MAKES SENSE WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT IMAGE {SL} IS THE DOCTOR GIVING GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS {SL} I MEAN IT REALLY DEP- IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE ALTHOUGH ONE ONE COULD UH ONE COULD ASSUME THAT IT'S BAD NEWS {BR} BECAUSE IN GENERAL THAT'S WHY YOU GO TO A DOCTOR TO HEAR SUCH STUFF HOWEVER SUCH COULD BE THE CASE IN WHICH THE DOCTOR IS UH {SL} HELPI- IS UH SAYING THAT THERE'S REALLY NO {SL} UH SYMPTOM NO UH SEVERE SYMPTOMS THAT COULD BE LIFE THREATENING FOR THE PATIENT SO {SL} UNLESS WE KNOW THE ACTUAL SITUATION THERE IS REALLY NO {SL} UH DETERMINANT ANSWER FOR THIS OK {SL} HOW DO THE TWO PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT FEEL {BR} UH AGAIN SAME AS QUESTION NUMBER ONE FOR THIS IMAGE IT'S REALLY ALL DEPENDENT ON ON THE CIRCUM- CIRCUMSTANCE SO DEPENDING ON WHAT THE DOCTOR HAS TOLD THEM BASED UPON THE DIAGNOSIS OF THE MAN UM {SL} IN THE PURPLE SHIRT UH IT REALLY ALL- I MEAN THEY COULD BE A LITTLE I MEAN {SL} BUT JUDGING SOLELY BY THIS PHOTO IT COULD BE AS IF THEY WERE NERVOUS TO FIGURE OUT AND LEARN ABOUT THE RESULTS AS TO WHO IT IS THAT HAS THE ILLNESS THAT THE DOCTOR'S TRYING TO PINPOINT FOR OK THAT MAKES SENSE WHAT IS THE PROFESSION OF THE MAN ON THE LEFT {SL} OH {SL} I ONE COULD SAFELY ASSUME HE'S AN M D MEDICAL DOCTOR {SL} OK AND WHERE IS THIS CONVERSATION TAKING PLACE I BELIEVE IT IS IT IS IN {SL} THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR AS AS THERE'S A ROUND TABLE BECAUSE A DOCTOR MIGHT NOT HAVE THAT MUCH SPACE IT COULD BE IN THEIR IT COULD BE IN A PRIVATE LIKE EQUIVALENT TO LIKE WHAT A PRIVATE FUNCTION ROOM MIGHT BE IN A LARGE CORPORATE BUSINESS BUT THIS IS JUST LIKE A SORT OF A COFFEE ROOM PER SE FOR UH MEDICAL DOCTORS {SL} OK GREAT {SL} WHAT MIGHT THIS PERSON BE TRYING TO DO {NS} HUH TALKING TO A C S MAJOR PERHAPS DEBUGGING CODE UM {SL} SOMETHING I'VE GOTTA FACE WITH LATER {LG} ON A SIDE TANGENT OR {BR} {SL} LOOKS AS IF THAT PERSON IS MALE SO I'LL I'LL G- GO ON THAT UH GOOD FAITH ASSUMPTION HE COULD BE UH {SL} UH HIS HIS UH {SL} HIS COMPUTER MIGHT HAVE CRASHED HIS OPERATING SYSTEM MIGHT HAVE CRASHED UM HE COULD RIGHT NOW BE FACING WITH A LONG PERIOD OF THAT NOTABLE BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH EITHER ON X BOX SYSTEMS OR OTHER MICROSOFT WINDOWS SYSTEMS OR {BR} ANY MICROSOFT SYSTEMS FOR THAT MATTER {SL} OK WHY IS THIS PERSON FRUSTRATED UH AS I SAID EARLIER BEFORE IT COULD BE FOR A BUGGY PROGRAM THE BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH UH {SL} YOU KNOW OR JUDGING BY THE NOTE CARDS HE COULD BE HAVING SO MANY EMAILS BEING SENT TO HIM SO MUCH SPAM SO MANY UH PEOPLE TRYING TO LURE HIM TO DO SOMETHING THAT HE'S SO INTIMIDATED BY THAT HE'S JUST FREAKING OUT AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE HE CAN DO MM OK WHAT EQUIPMENT IS HE USING UH {SL} IT LOOKS AS IF I MEAN UH MACHI- ON A MACHINERY POINT OF VIEW IT LOOKS AS IF HE HAS A MONITOR HE HAS A MAIN COMPUTER BASE UH A UH REGULAR COMPUTER AND A FAX MACHINE AND IT LOOKS AS IF HE ALSO HAS UM OTHER UH PAPER DOCUMENTS AS WELL AS UH BINDERS AND BOOKS TO ORGANIZE UM PAPER DOCUMENTS {SL} OK AND WHAT WILL HE DO NEXT {SL} UH IF HE'S SANE HE'LL PROBABLY JUST UH YOU KNOW UH {SL} TRY TO FIND A WAY TO COOL OFF GO TO A BREAK ROOM IF HIS BOSS ALLOWS IT OR IF HIS BOSS IS GOING TO GO PISSY AT HIM HE'LL JUST PROBABLY UH {SL} YOU KNOW UH SOME OTHER STANDARD TECHNIQUE THAT'S UH {SL} YOU KNOW COMMON TO COOL SOME PERSON DOWN IF HE'S AN INSANE PERSON HE'LL PROBABLY I DON'T KNOW GO ON A RAMPAGE OUTSIDE OF HIS OFFICE THAT'LL PROBABLY CAUSE HIM YOU KNOW TO BE PULLED OVER BY UM THE AUTHORITIES AND HE'LL PROBABLY BE GET SENT TO PRISON IF HE'S REALLY INSANE {SL} OK MAKES SENSE {SL} WHY IS THIS PICTURE FUNNY {SL} BECAUSE IT SHOWS UH {SL} I MEAN IT'S {SL} IT'S REALLY HARD TO DETERMINE BUT ONE COULD SAY THAT THERE COULD BE A MULTITUDE OF ANSWERS ONE COULD BE BECAUSE IT'S IT DEPICTS ALIENS WHO HAVE SOMEHOW {BR} UH {SL} BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS {SL} OUR OUR LIFE FORM THAT IS TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL TO EARTH AND LAND ON IT OTHERS MIGHT SAY IT'S JUST BECAUSE THERE IS A TIC TAC TOE UM {SL} MAZE IN THE CORNFIELD AND IT'S THREE DIMENSIONAL AND THE ALIENS MIGHT HAVE DONE IT AND SO IT'S KIND OF HILARIOUS FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE THEY HAD {BR} I DON'T KNOW MAYBE HAD SEEN IT FROM SPACE UH REALLY IT'S HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE IN THAT SENSE BUT THOSE ARE THE TWO I CAN PROVIDE FOR YOU SURE WHAT DOES THE CROP CIRCLE LOOK LIKE {SL} UH {SL} I MEAN {SL} I MEAN IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHICH CROP CIRCLE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT {SL} IT COULD LOOK LIKE ONE COULD PERHAPS INTERPRET IT AS LIKE A BLACK HOLE SORT OF THING IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THAT BUT THEN AGAIN {BR} IT THE CENTER LIKE THE IT HAS TO BE FULL FULLY A BLACK CIRCLE THAT IS UH THE UH CORN THE ALL OF THE CIRCLE FILLED WITH BLACK AND THEN IT COULD PERHAPS REPRESENT MAYBE LIKE A BLACK HOLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AT WHICH POINT IT'S YOU KNOW THOSE ALIENS WILL BE SUCKED IN ANYHOW SO {SL} BUT YEAH I MEAN ONE COULD SAY IT LOOKS LIKE A BLACK HOLE JUDGING FROM THE BASIS OF THE UH ANGULARITY {SL} OK {SL} WHERE ARE THE TWO GREEN MEN FROM {SL} UH I COULD SAY I DON'T KNOW LIKE FROM ANOTHER PLANET LIKE YOU KNOW THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIKE IT'S ALMOST KIND OF LIKE ASKING WHERE IS THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL FROM AND MAYBE WE COULD SAY YOU KNOW FROM ANOTHER GALAXY {SL} OK GREAT AND WHY IS THE MAN ON THE LEFT POINTING AND SMILING {BR} HE MIGHT HAVE UH {SL} HE MIGHT HAVE TRICKED PER SE TRICKER THE FARMER WHO OWNS THIS LAND THAT HE IS ACTUALLY GONNA USE HIS WHEAT TO MAKE ALIEN BREAD THAT WOULD H- HELP HIS UH RACE SURVIVE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD HOWEVER HE MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN YOU KNOW {SL} A LYING BASTARD AND JUST UH DECIDED TO THINK THAT'S A FUNNY GAME TO PLAY TIC TAC TOE INSTEAD AND UH TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FARMER AND THEY'RE JUST YOU KNOW {SL} BEHAVING TERRIBLY TOWARDS HIM OK ALRIGHT UM LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ONE {SL} WHY IS THE WOMAN THE SECOND FROM THE RIGHT LOOKING AT THE MAN {SL} I BELIEVE SHE IS CONVINCED THAT THE MAN WHO IS TO HER RIGHT MIGHT BE HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH HER {SL} OK {SL} SO WHAT ACTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE {SL} THERE IS ANOTHER GIRL ON {SL} TO THE LEFT WHO LOOKS LOOKS THE ONE HOLDING THE MAN'S WAIST THE UH YEAH THE UH MAN WITH THE BROWN HAIR HIS WAIST IT LOOKS AS IF SHE MIGHT BE UH HIS GIRLFRIEND OR WHATNOT OR JUST YOU KNOW JUST IN A RELATIONSHIP ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T REALLY {SL} REALLY TOO CUSTOMARY LIKE THAT FROM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ASSUMING WAS BACK IN PERHAPS SAY THE FIFTEEN

BIRD CATCHER AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE LATTER IT'S ONE COULD PERHAPS EVEN ARGUE THAT IT'S TOTALLY TOTALLY UNETHICAL {SL} OK MAKES SENSE AND IS IT REALISTIC FOR AN EGG TO HATCH WHILE DROPPING {SL} UH {SL}

GAME OF POKER UH DURING THIS SORT OF TIME PERIOD ALTHOUGH NOW IS THE SAME {SL} OK {SL} MAKES SENSE {SL} WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS PICTURE {SL} UH IT'S LIKE AN E M T SORT OF TRAINING SEMINAR IN WHICH THERE IS LIKE A E M T PROFESSIONAL THE AFRICAN AMERICAN UH INDIVIDUAL WHO IS TRYING TO LECTURE THE OTHER TWO INDIVIDUALS ON HOW TO UH {SL} HOW TO TRAIN AS AN E M T OR SIMPLY COULD JUST BE AN E M T UH PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THE MAN IN THE CENTER ABOUT WHAT HIS CONDITION WAS WHICH RESULTED IN AN E M T SHOWING UP TO RESUSCITATE HIM {SL} WHAT IS THE PROFESSION OF THE MAN ON THE LEFT {SL} I BELIEVE E M T STANDS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRAINER SO HE'S BASICALLY HE'S NOT A DOCTOR BUT HE'S BASICALLY {SL} SORT OF LIKE WHAT IS ANALOGOUS TO POLICE AND SWAT HE'S JUST BASICALLY A A QUICK RESPONDER TO SOMEBODY WHO IS IN DESPAIR AND NEED IN THIS CASE MEDICALLY {SL} OK {SL} WHAT ARE THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS PICTURE {SL} UH {SL} WELL THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN HE'S JUST BASICALLY E M T SO HE HAS NO BLOOD RELATION TO THE OTHER TWO INDIVIDUALS SO I'M GONNA THINK THAT THE OTHER TWO INDIVIDUALS THE MAN IS THE FATHER AND THE WOMAN IS THE DAUGHTER {SL} OK {SL} SURE AND APPROXIMATELY HOW OLD IS EACH PERSON I'D SAY THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN MIGHT BE YOU KNOW EARLY FORTIES THE MAN IN THE CENTER HE'S PROBABLY LIKE UH {SL} LIKE SEVENTIES OR EIGHTIES EVEN AND THE GIRL ON THE RIGHT SHE'S LIKE
