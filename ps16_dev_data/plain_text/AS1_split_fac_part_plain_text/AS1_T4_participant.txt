OK sp OK sp OK sp NOT GOOD WITH REMEMBERING TERMINOLOGY BUT I AM OK WITH REMEMBERING sp HOW sp STUFF WORKS sp {LS} sp OH sp AH CRAP IT'S BEEN LIKE OVER A YEAR SINCE I'VE sp DONE sp THIS sp PART sp UM sp I DON'T KNOW I WAS AT FIRST GOING TO GUESS sp FLOORS sp BUT sp UM sp AH sp AND I KNOW THE X WAS TIMES sp BUT sp I sp CAN'T REMEMBER IF sp ONE OF THEM WAS INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE sp UM sp THE FACT THAT THE C IS THERE DOESN'T HELP sp {BR} sp I'M sp NOT sp QUITE SURE sp TO BE HONEST sp UM FIFTY sp UH TWENTY THREE sp UH FIFTY FOUR AND SEVENTY SIX sp UH NINE AND FOURTEEN sp I DON'T KNOW sp THE F ER EXACT sp FUNCTION BUT IT USES UH sp AN IF STATEMENT sp UH LET'S sp SEE IF Y EQUALS ZERO RETURN X sp I'VE I'M NOT SURE I'VE EVER SEEN THIS ONE YET ACTUALLY sp UM SO I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT TYPE sp OF FUNCTION IT IS sp UH sp IF IT DOESN'T RETURN Y EQUALS ZERO sp IT CALLS ITSELF sp UNTIL UM sp {BR} sp {NS} sp UH sp LET'S SEE sp X sp MODULO Y sp SO IF Y DOESN'T EQUAL ZERO IT sp CALLS ITSELF AND IT CHANGES THE VARIABLES sp SO THAT sp UH sp WELL IT BASICALLY KEEPS GOING UNTIL IT sp UM sp Y EQUALS sp ER IT KEEPS DOING UH X MODULO Y UNTIL UH sp Y EQUALS ZERO BUT IT CHANGES sp THE PLACEMENT OF X AND Y EACH TIME sp SO I'M NOT sp QUITE POSITIVE sp ALTHOUGH I DO sp IT DOES sp CHANGE BOTH IT'S sp MEANT TO UH sp CHANGE sp X sp BY A CERTAIN FACTOR sp UNTIL IT GETS TO A CERTAIN POINT sp {BR} sp UH I'M sp SO sp I'M sp SO TERRIBLE AT REMEMBERING sp UH {NS} sp WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS THIS EXACTLY sp OH PSEUDOCODE OK sp UM sp I'VE sp I'VE NEVER SEEN A sp TO STATEMENT OR A DO STATEMENT sp UH sp A LIST sp {NS} OH IT ORDERS A LIST sp IT BASICALLY ORDERS THE sp UH sp IT ORDERS THE LIST FROM LEAST TO GREATEST sp ALTHOUGH I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT sp BUT IT DOES AT THE VERY LEAST MOVE EVERYTHING CLOSER TO BEING sp FROM LEAST TO GREATEST sp OH WAIT IT'S UNTIL sp UNTIL NOT sp SWAPPED SO sp IT IS sp UM sp IT IS UNTIL UH sp IT ORDERS sp ALL THE WAY THROUGH sp OK sp I DON'T sp QUITE REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE FUNCTION AS I SAID I'M TERRIBLE WITH NAMES FOR TERMINOLOGY sp UM sp THE sp TURN A sp IS UH FOR EVERY sp UM sp THE E sp WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT sp FOR EVERY BLANK sp THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE sp UM sp THE BACKWARDS E MEANS sp EXISTS sp WHICH MEANS THAT sp THERE IS A SITUATION WHERE sp THAT EXISTS sp I BELIEVE THE V WAS sp OR sp AND THE UPSIDE DOWN V WAS AND sp OR MEANS THAT sp UH sp IT IS sp ONE sp OR sp THAT IT sp IS sp ONE OR BOTH OF THEM IS TRUE sp UH CAUSE XOR IS SOMETHING ELSE sp AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT REPRESENTS sp THE UPSIDE DOWN V IS AND WHICH MEANS THAT sp BOTH CASES ARE TRUE sp AND THE ARROW MEANS IMPLIES WHICH MEANS THAT sp THEY ARE EITHER BOTH FALSE sp UM sp I IF I REMEMBER IT'S EITHER BOTH FALSE sp ONE'S FALSE AND THE ONE ON THE OTHER END IS TRUE sp BUT IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT UM sp ONE sp AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ARROW IS TRUE AND THE OTHER ONE IS FALSE sp UH sp OH YOU MEAN FOR EACH OF THEM sp UH sp GOD IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE DONE THIS sp UH sp FOR EVERY X sp UM sp FOR EVERY X UH C sp UH X AND sp FOR EVERY X C X AND U X sp UH sp ER WAIT I I FEEL LIKE X MEANT SOMETHING TOO sp OR AT LEAST THAT SPECIFIC sp KIND OF X sp BUT sp FOR EVERY UM sp FOR EVERY CASE sp C IS UH sp C IS THE SAME AS V WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR FALSE sp UM sp WELL A WOULD BE sp UH sp EXAMPLE A IN BIG LETTERS AT THE TOP OF THE sp PAGE sp EXAMPLE B WOULD BE IN sp QUITE sp SOMEWHAT SMALLER LETTERS AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE sp AND EXAMPLE C WOULD BE sp IN UM MUCH LITTLER sp AH sp ER EXAMPLE B WOULD BE SLIGHTLY BELOW A sp AND THEN EXAMPLE C WOULD BE IN sp DECENTLY SMALLER LETTERS BELOW ALL THAT sp DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE REST OF IT DOES TOO OR sp ER OH WAIT OH sp NO sp UH EXAMPLE ONE WOULD ALSO BE UH IN THE ARIAL FONT sp UM WITH sp A sp PINK BOX AROUND IT WITH sp UH THE FONT sp COLORED RED sp UM sp WHEREAS UM sp H TWO sp H TWO WOULD BE UH sp OH YEAH AND sp H ONE WOULD ALSO BE OVER TO THE LEFT H TWO WOULD BE CENTERED sp MEANING IT'S sp NEAR THE MIDDLE sp UH sp IN REGARDS TO LEFT AND RIGHT sp UM sp AND IT WOULD BE COLORED BLUE sp UH AND IT WOULD HAVE NO BACKGROUND COLOR I DON'T QUITE REMEMBER IF THAT WOULD MAKE THE BACKGROUND WHITE OR sp STILL PINK FROM sp THE HEADER ONE BUT IT DON'T sp THINK IT WOULD BE sp UH PINK I THINK IT WOULD BE WHITE sp UM AND THEN EXAMPLE C sp WOULD HAVE A BOX AROUND IT COLORED YELLOW AND THE TEXT WOULD BE COLORED GREEN AND IT WOULD BE ON THE LEFT sp AND THE BACKGROUND ER WAIT NO THE BACKGROUND FOR sp H TWO WOULD BE GREY sp BECAUSE THAT'S HOW sp OH sp WELL NO I FORGET THE sp HEADER COUNT'S IN THE BODY I sp DON'T sp I'M NOT SURE MOST OF THE PAGE WOULD BE GREY I BELIEVE sp THE BACKGROUND FOR EXAMPLE B WOULD BE sp GREY sp UM sp A LOOP IS WHEN sp A NUMBER CAN CALL sp IS WHEN ER NOT A NUMBER BUT I sp GUESS A NODE sp CAN CALL ITSELF sp SO IT CAN TRAVERSE sp RIGHT BACK TO ITSELF WITHOUT HAVING sp TO TRAVERSE TO ANOTHER ONE sp OK sp SO YOU CAN GO FROM ONE TO THREE sp FROM THREE TO THE DIFFERENT THREE sp FROM THREE TO THE FIVE AND THEN FROM FIVE sp BACK TO THE FIVE sp ER WAIT NO sp THAT'S sp ACTUALLY sp OH THE NUMBERS ARE THE NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS OK sp UM sp SO I THINK I HAD THAT WRONG sp BUT sp IN THAT SITUATION sp THERE ARE sp I WOULD SAY sp ARE sp BY MY FIRST DEFINITION THERE'S sp ONE LOOP sp BUT sp BY ANOTHER DEFINITION IF I RECALL IT'S WHEN YOU CAN START AT ONE POINT sp AND THEN GO ALL THE WAY BACK AROUND sp TO IT WITHOUT sp PASSING OVER THE SAME ONE TWICE sp AND BY THAT DEFINITION sp UM sp THERE WOULD BE ONE sp UH sp ONE TWO THREE sp LOOPS sp THERE'D BE THE THREE THE TWO AND THE FIVE THE THREE THE THREE AND THE FIVE AND THE TWO sp AND THE THREE THE THREE THE TWO THE FIVE AND THE TWO sp UH sp AN ORPHAN sp I'M I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE sp PROPER sp TERMINOLOGY BUT THAT'S WHAT sp I'D sp UM sp CALL IT sp GOD IT FEELS LIKE IT'S BEEN AGES SINCE sp I'VE DONE SOME OF THIS STUFF sp I NEED A REFRESHER ON SOME OF THIS sp WELL sp THERE IS THE sp PRICE OF sp THE WAFFLES THE KINDS OF sp FOODS AVAILABLE sp THE UH sp THERE IS sp THE CALORIES sp FOR sp THE WAFFLES sp UM sp AND THERE'S DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE TYPES OF WAFFLES sp UM sp WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY WHAT KIND OF CODING LIKE THE NAME FOR THE sp FORMAT OR THE TYPE IT WOULD BE USED sp UM sp I AM NOT sp HONESTLY SURE sp AS I SAID I'M TERRIBLE WITH sp TERMINOLOGY sp UM sp {NS} sp I'M NOT SURE I'VE sp QUITE EXPERIENCED THIS TYPE BEFORE sp UH I MAY HAVE AND FORGOTTEN IT sp BUT sp UM ONE BENEFIT IS THAT sp ALL OF THE UH TYPES APPEAR TO HAVE THE SAME sp I GUESS YOU'D SAY VARIABLES sp SO IT IT APPEARS FAIRLY ORGANIZED sp MHM sp AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE FAIRLY EASY TO SORT RELATED FACTORS sp AND SEARCH YOU COULD SEARCH STUFF I sp SUPPOSE sp UM sp AH I FORGET WHAT THEY'RE CALLED sp UM sp IT'S NOT A sp IT'S NOT A TREE sp I I JUST sp I FORGET WHAT IT'S CALLED sp UM sp ARE sp ARE THE LINES WEIGHTED sp ER WAIT NO sp THERE sp THERE ISN'T A PATH sp ER WAIT NO sp THE SHORTEST PATH IS UH EIGHT SIX TWO sp AND sp THE ONLY PATH REALLY sp UNLESS YOU GO EIGHT SIX SEVEN EIGHT SIX SEVEN HOWEVER MANY TIMES BACK TO sp TWO sp UH sp BUT YOU HAVE TO sp GO OVER SIX TO GET TO TWO sp SO sp EIGHT SIX TWO IS THE SHORTEST PATH sp IF I RECALL A CYCLE sp SEE I DON'T REMEMBER HEARING ONE CALLED sp A TOUR BEFORE sp I KNOW WE'VE GONE OVER THIS KIND OF THING sp I I REMEMBER EULER CIRCUITS AND STUFF sp STUFF LIKE THAT sp BUT sp UM sp I WANNA SAY IT'S A sp UH sp MEANDER THAT VISITS sp ALL OF THEM ONCE sp OR IT COULD BE ONE THAT GOES THE sp SAME WAY sp THIS AROUND THE SAME THING sp BUT I'M GONNA SAY ONE THAT UH VISITS ALL OF THEM ONCE ESPECIALLY CAUSE YOU SAID A TOUR sp AND THAT'S WHAT A TOUR MAKES ME THINK OF sp UM sp WELL sp IF IT HAS TO PASS OVER ALL OF THEM ONCE sp THERE ARE NONE sp BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO sp BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS OVER ALL OF THEM ONCE sp UM sp IF sp IT DOESN'T sp BUT IT CAN'T LIKE JUST LOOP INFINITELY sp THEN THERE WOULD sp HAVE sp TO sp BE ONE CAUSE AS SOON AS YOU GET TO THREE YOU CAN ONLY GO TO NINE sp UM AND YOU CAN ONLY GET TO THREE sp FROM sp FIVE sp WHICH CAN ONLY BE REACHED BY FOUR sp WHICH CAN ONLY BE REACHED BY TWO sp BUT THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO VISIT FOUR TWICE sp UM sp IS WHY I DO NOT sp THINK THAT IT IS THE UH sp KIND THAT IS UH sp IF IT IS sp THE sp FACT THAT IT HAS TO sp GO TO ALL OF THEM ONCE THEN IT sp THEN IT HAS NONE sp BUT OTHERWISE IT HAS ONE sp OH I'VE FORGOTTEN THIS sp BUT I'LL TRY sp UH sp AH sp I KNOW O O OF ONE IS BASICALLY sp A sp CONSTANT SO IT MEANS THAT HOWEVER sp HOWEVER MANY UH sp TIMES IT sp ER HOWEVER MANY UH sp THINGS ARE BEING sp OH I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE PROPER sp TERMINOLOGY NOW sp HOWEVER MANY UH sp ARE BEING DONE IT WON'T CHANGE THE UH COMPLEXITY sp UH sp I FORGOT THE sp EXPLANATION sp EXCLAMATION POINT WAS sp BUT FOR N IT MEANS THAT THE sp UH sp THE COMPLEXITY IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE NUMBER sp OF FACTORS IN IT sp FOR N SQUARED IT sp INCREASES sp EXPONENTIALLY SO sp UH IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLEX TO HAVE UH sp THREE THAN IT IS TO HAVE sp TWO FOR EXAMPLE sp UM sp FOR O LOG N IT'S sp THE OPPOSITE WHICH MEANS THAT sp IT sp CONTINUALLY GETS MORE COMPLEX sp BUT sp IT sp UM sp DOESN'T sp INCREASE sp IT IT sp INCREASES KIND OF LIKE sp {NS} {NS} sp UH THAT sp UM sp WELL sp THE ONE I JUST GAVE sp UH sp EITHER O OF ONE sp OR sp O OF LOG N BECAUSE sp BOTH OF THOSE ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH sp UH VERY sp LARGE NUMBERS OF FACTORS sp THIS IS OVERALL sp I MEAN sp IF YOU'RE NOT USING VERY MANY IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER QUITE AS MUCH sp IF YOU'RE NOT USING AS MANY UH sp AS I SAID I'M TERRIBLE AT TERMINOLOGY sp BUT YEAH sp A VERT- UH -EX IF I RECALL IS ANYWHERE sp TWO LINES MEET sp SO THERE ARE sp ANY OF THE NUMBER OF POINTS IS A VERTEX SO THERE'S EIGHT sp VERTEXES sp AN EDGE IS A LINE BETWEEN TWO VERTEXES sp SO THERE'S ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE sp SIX SEVEN EIGHT sp NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE sp TWELVE EDGES sp IN ORDER sp OR sp THE SHORTEST PATH FROM ONE TO SIX IS TWO EDGES AND IF YOU WANT TO USE THE sp TWO SHORTEST EDGES sp GO sp FIVE SIX sp HOWEVER THE EDGES DON'T APPEAR WEIGHTED SO sp THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS AN EDGE sp BETWEEN THEM sp
