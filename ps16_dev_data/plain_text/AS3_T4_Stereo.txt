ALRIGHT YEP OK GREAT ALRIGHT SO THIS NEXT SECTION LIKE I SAID IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE JUST DID EXCEPT THIS TIME WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT SOME BASIC MATH AND PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS YES SO FOR THESE QUESTIONS ASSUME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE MATHEMATICAL THEORIES YES SO PLEASE EXPLAIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER IT LIKE YOU'RE TUTORING ME OK OK OK AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE ANSWER IS PLEASE TRY TO GUESS AND IF YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY UNSURE JUST TELL ME THAT YOU WANNA SKIP THE QUESTION OH YEAH ALRIGHT FAIR ENOUGH ALRIGHT THEN WE ARE GOING TO START OFF AGAIN BY CALIBRATING THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES WE'LL DO THAT QUICKLY {SL} ON THE LEFT ARE EXPRESSIONS YES AND ON THE RIGHT ARE SETS {SL} ON THE LEFT WHAT DO THE U UPSIDE-DOWN U AND X SYMBOLS STAND FOR {SL} UM {SL} THE U SYMBOL MEANS UNION SO A UNION B IN THIS CASE WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT UM {SL} YOU HAVE A SET A IS EQUAL TO ONE TWO AND YOU'VE GOT ELEMENTS ONE TWO AND THREE LIKEWISE WITH B YOU HAVE A SET AND YOU'VE GOT ELEMENTS FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT WHAT YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING IS THAT {SL} WITH THESE ELEMENTS YOU'RE CONJOINING THEM TOGETHER YOU'RE COMBINING THEM TOGETHER SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE NEW SET IN WHICH IT CONTAINS ELEMENTS FROM BOTH A AND BOTH B AND IF THERE'S A REPEAT THEN IT'S JUST {SL} IT IT WON'T BE UM A REPEAT IN THE NEW SET UM THE UPSIDE-DOWN U IS DIS DISJOINT SO WHAT THAT BASICALLY MEANS IS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIND TWO ELEMENTS OF A SET IN BOTH SETS THAT ARE EQUAL IN VALUE SO FOR B AND C BECAUSE YOU YOU'VE GOT ELEMENTS FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT {SL} IT'S GONNA BE FOR B AND C IT'S GONNA BE UNION SIX SEVEN EIGHT I MEAN DISJOINT EXCUSE ME DISJOINT WHY BECAUSE THIS IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT WE WANNA FIND ELEMENTS IN BOTH B AND C UM IN BOTH IN BOTH {SL} UH SETS WE WANNA FIND ELEMENTS THAT ARE THE SAME IN BOTH B AND C LIKEWISE WITH A AND C SO THAT'S ANOTHER DISJOINT {SL} THAT'S JUST GONNA BE UH {SL} UM {SL} NULL SO IT'S JUST LIKE A ZERO WITH A SLASH THROUGH IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO ELEMENT BE BETWEEN A AND C THAT ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AND THE X IT'S JUST YOUR STANDARD UH UM {SL} MULTIPLICATION SO UH HOW YOU MULTIPLY SETS IS YOU BASICALLY UH {SL} IT'S A DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY SO FIRST YOU DO X {SL} FIRST YOU UH START WITH X SO LIKE X PLUS TWO X PLUS THREE X PLUS X PLUS Y X TWO Y PLUS UM PLUS THREE Y BECAUSE YOU ARE DISTRIBUTING BETWEEN THE TWO THE THREE ELEMENTS IN SET A AND THE TWO ELEMENTS IN SET B TO {SL} GET A PRODUCT {SL} OK {SL} GREAT SO GIVEN THE SETS ON THE RIGHT WHAT SETS WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE LEFT {SL} UH I THINK I STATED THIS EARLIER BEFORE BUT A UNION B IS WOULD BE CONTAIN THE SET ELEMENTS ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT {BR} B DISJOINT C {BR} WOULD JUST CONTAIN ELEMENTS SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT A DISJOINT C IS NULL BECAUSE BOTH SETS DON'T HAVE EQUAL VALUES AND A TIMES D IS X PLUS TWO X PLUS THREE X PLUS Y PLUS TWO Y PLUS THREE Y OK GREAT {SL} WHAT IS THE ROOT NODE {SL} FIFTY OK AND WHAT IS THE PARENT NODE OF NINETEEN {SL} TWENTY THREE {SL} OK WHAT ARE THE CHILD NODES OF SEVENTY TWO {SL} FIFTY FOUR AND SEVENTY SIX {SL} OK AND WHAT ARE THE SIBLING NODES OF TWELVE {SL} NEVER HEARD THAT TERM BUT ON GOOD FAITH I'M GONNA SAY TWENTY THREE OK {SL} GREAT {SL} WHAT SPECIAL TYPE OF FUNCTION IS THIS {SL} WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SPECIAL {SL} UM IT'S UP TO YOU {BR} I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PER SE BUT ONE MIGHT BE ABLE TO THINK THAT THIS MIGHT BE UH {SL} NOT EXACTLY UH {SL} UM TYPICAL WAY OF PROGRAMMING SO {SL} YOU SEE YOU NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE UH AN ELSE STATEMENT THAT SAYS RETURN G C D Y X PERCENT SIGN Y WHAT THAT PERCENT SIGN BASICALLY MEANS IS MOD SO YOU'RE BASICALLY MOD ESSENTIALLY IS BETWEEN X MOD Y IS BASICALLY YOU'RE UM {SL} HOW DO I PUT THIS YOU'RE UH DIVIDING UH {SL} X WITH Y {SL} AND WITHIN THAT VALUE YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND THE D- THE REMAINDER OF {SL} UM X AND Y SO LET'S SAY X IS EQUAL TO I DON'T KNOW NINE AND Y IS EQUAL TO TWO SO IF YOU DIVIDE THOSE THEN YOU'LL GET A REMAINDER OF ONE IN WHICH CASE Y Y'S NEW VALUE FOR {SL} G FOR G C D AS THE FIRST UH ARGUMENT THAT WOULD EQUAL TO {SL} EXCUSE ME UM ONE AND THEN YOU JUST CONTINUE THROUGH THIS FUNCTION {SL} FROM THE TOP AT G C D {SL} OK GREAT AND WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO UM CALCULATES THE GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR OF {SL} UH {SL} TWO NUMBERS WHICH I'M PRESUMABLY GONNA ASSUME IS ONE NUMERATOR AND IS ONE DENOMINATOR X AND Y RESPECTIVELY {SL} OK GREAT {SL} WHAT DOES THIS FUNCTION DO {SL} SO IT'S BASICALLY JUST TRYING TO UH {SL} S- IT'S BASICALLY SWAPPING {SL} UM TWO VALUES IF IF THEY'RE LIKE IN AN ORDERED ARRAY IF THERE IS ONE VALUE IN THE ARRAY THAT IS GREATER IF IF IF THE FIRST VALUE OF THE ARRAY IS GREATER THAN THE NEXT VALUE BOTH VALUES SHOULD BE SWAPPED SO AS TO UH BE IN UH CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER {SL} OK AND WHAT IS THE FORMAL NAME FOR THIS TYPE OF FUNCTION {SL} I MEAN GEN- GENERALLY SPEAKING I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED SORT BUT FROM THIS ALGORITHM IT SEEMS AS IF IT'S CLOSE TO WHAT A BUBBLE SORT IS OK GREAT {SL} EXPLAIN EACH OF THE SYMBOLS ON THE LEFT OK SO THE UPSIDE-DOWN CAPITAL A IS THE U IS THE UH UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIER WHICH MEANS THAT THERE IS AN ELEMENT FOR IF YOU PUT THAT IF YOU PUT THAT QUANTIFIER IN FRONT OF A VARIABLE WHAT THAT BASICALLY MEANS IS {SL} IT APPLIES TO ALL OF THIS VARIABLE NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE IS AND THE BACKWARDS CAPITAL THE REVERSE CAPITAL E THAT'S AN EXISTENTIAL QUANTIFIER AND THAT'S HOW I LIKE TO THINK OF IT E BEGINS WITH EXISTENTIAL ANYWAYS UH SO WHAT THAT JUST MEANS IS {BR} THERE HAS TO BE CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT ARE MET IN ORDER FOR THAT FUNCTION UH I MEAN FOR THAT VARIABLE CONTAINING THAT QUANTIFIER TO TAKE PLACE SO IT'S GOTTA BE CER- CER- CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IT HAS TO BE YOU KNOW MAYBE LESS THAN THIS NUMBER GREATER THAN THAT NUMBER WHATEVER SO THE CAPITAL V STANDS FOR IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS ANYWAYS IT STANDS FOR OR SO IN A TRUTH SO THIS IS BASICALLY GONNA GO TO I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT TRUTH TABLES OR VALUES REPRESENT BOOLEAN VARIABLES AND BOOLEAN VARIABLES ARE THEY SOUND INTIMIDATING BUT THEY ARE JUST SIMPLY SOMETHING IS EITHER TRUE OR SOMETHING IS FALSE OR IN UM BINARY INTEGER OPERATIONS ZERO AND ONE RESPECTIVELY SO YOU'RE BASICALLY JUST SAYING UM IF SOMETHING IF ZERO OR ONE THEN IT'S ONE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS AND THEN EVERY EVERYTHING ELSE SHOULD BE {SL} FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD IF YOU'RE JUST SAYING LIKE UH {SL} ZERO OR ONE ONE OR ZERO IT'S UM {SL} ONE IN BOTH CASES AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE {SL} UH IN BOTH CASES YOU STILL HAVE AN ELEMENT THAT IS TRUE SO THEREFORE IT'S GONNA BE TRUE {SL} WHAT LOOKS LIKE THAT WHAT LOOKS LIKE A CARET SYMBOL UM IN LITERATURE LITERARY EDITING THAT BASICALLY STANDS FOR AND AND IT'S {SL} ESSENTIALLY THE RE- THE UH {SL} CONTRARY TO WHAT OR IS SO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OR ZERO ZERO OR ONE IS EQUAL TO ZERO JUST BECAUSE {SL} BOTH CONDITIONS ARE NOT EQUALLY {SL} IDENTICAL TO EACH OTHER SO IT'S FALSE BOTH CONDITIONS WILL BE FALSE AT THAT POINT SO THE ARROW THERE JUST MEANS UM AN IMPLICATION STATEMENT IT'S SIMPLY JUST IF THERE IS {SL} IF THERE IS A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENS TO THE LEFT OF THE AREA ARROW EXCUSE ME THEN THERE'S ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE RIGHT OF THE ARROW THAT'S GOING TO UH TAKE PLACE FOR {SL} UH {SL} FOR WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEFT OF THE ARROW {SL} OK {SL} GREAT SO USING THE EXPRESSIONS ON THE RIGHT CREATE AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE AND YOU CAN DEFINE THE VARIABLES HOWEVER YOU WANT OK {SL} I'M GONNA GO WITH THE FIRST EXAMPLE AND I'M GONNA SAY FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH {SL} IF ONE HUMAN BEING DECIDES TO HAVE AN AFFAIR AND CHEAT ON HIS OR HER GIRLFRIEND OR WIFE OR WHATNOT THEN {SL} THEY ARE {SL} THEY ARE DOOMED FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE BY BEING HAUNTED BY WHAT THEY HAVE DONE {SL} OR OR ANOTHER SITUATION COULD BE FOR P OF X {SL} THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTNER DECIDES TO DUMP THEM {SL} OK {SL} GREAT {SL} ON A WEBSITE THIS WOULD PRODUCE WHAT DOES EXAMPLE A B AND C LOOK LIKE {SL} I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE SAY EXAMPLE A IS GOING TO PRINT A TEXT THAT'S GONNA BE IN ARIAL FONT IT'S GONNA HAVE A PINK BACKGROUND COLOR AND THE UH COLOR OF THE ACTUAL TEXT IS GONNA BE RED FOR EXAMPLE B THEY'RE GOING TO ALIGN THE UH {SL} TEXT TEXT OF TEXT SLASH C S S IN THE CENTER AND IT'S GONNA BE BLUE THE THE ACTUAL WORD TEXT AND FOR EXAMPLE C THE BACKGROUND COLOR FOR TEXT SLASH C S S WHEREVER THAT'S AROUND THEY'RE GONNA SURROUND THAT TOO THAT'S GONNA BE YELLOW {SL} RATHER THAN FROM BACKGROUND COLOR INITIALLY TO GREY AND THE COLOR OF THE TE- THE COLOR OF THE TEXT SLASH C S S TEXT FOR EXAMPLE C IS GONNA BE GREEN OK {SL} GREAT {SL} DESCRIBE TO ME USING THE PICTURE WHAT A LOOP IS {SL} THE ONLY LOOP I SEE HERE IS AT NODE FIVE AND WHAT A LOOP IS IS BASICALLY WHAT YOU WOULD THINK OF A LOOP IN A REAL LIFE SITUATION {SL} FOR EVERY NODE IT'S GOING THERE IS IT IS EITHER DIRECTED OR UNDIRECTED IF IT'S DIRECTED TO THE SAME NODE I E IT IS POINTING TO THE SAME NODE AS IT AS IT IS AT IT'S CURRENT SPOT THEN IT'S A LOOP BECAUSE YOU'RE BASICALLY GOING AROUND AND YOU'RE GOING BACK TO WHERE YOU ESSENTIALLY STARTED IN THAT SENSE OK HOW MANY LOOPS ARE THERE IN THIS PICTURE ONE OK {SL} AND WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THE ZERO VERTEX UH {SL} INFORMAL TERM IS OUTLIER {SL} BUT I BELIEVE THE TECHNICAL TERM IS CALLED UM {SL} UNCONNECTED NODE {SL} UM {SL} YES UNCONNECTED NODE AS FAR AS TO MY KNOWLEDGE OK {SL} DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS HERE {SL} I MEAN THIS IS STANDARD H T M L I SUPPOSE AND WHAT THIS STANDARD H T M L IS IS UH {SL} BASICALLY {SL} CREATING LIKE A LINE LIKE LINE BY LINE OR WORD FOR WORD RATHER DESCRIPTION FOR EACH WAFFLES AND WHAT THEY CONTAIN RESPECTIVELY SO UH {SL} I MEAN {SL} IT'S PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHTFORWARD I MEAN ALL I CAN REALLY SAY IS THAT PERHAPS WITHIN THE TWO DESCRIPTION UH MODULES THAT MIGHT {SL} ACTUALLY NO I TAKE THAT BACK IT'S JUST GONNA BE ON {SL} ONE LINE BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NO WAY OF {SL} CREATING A NEW LINE WITH THIS CODE {SL} UH BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO UH {SL} CREATE NEW MODULES FOR EACH FOOD CATEGORY WHICH IN THIS CASE {SL} ACTUALLY NO I TAKE BACK WHAT I EARLIER SAID SORRY THAT'S GONNA BE UM ON A NEW LINE OK {SL} ALRIGHT AND WHAT TYPE OF CODING IS THIS {SL} IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LANGUAGE I'M GONNA GO SAY IT'S H T M L SOME SOME SOME SORT OF MARKUP LANGUAGE SIMILAR TO H T M L BUT {SL} NONETHELESS MOST LIKELY FROM MY KNOWLEDGE ANYWAYS WHICH IS {BR} I'LL BE HONEST NOT REALLY UP THERE BUT I'LL I'LL GO WITH GOOD FAITH AND SAY THAT THIS IS H T M L OK MAKES SENSE {SL} WHAT KIND OF GRAPH IS THIS {SL} DIRECTED I MEAN IT'S DIRECTED BECAUSE EVERY NODE HAS IS POINTING TO ANOTHER NODE {SL} BUT {SL} AND IT'S ALSO DIRECTED BECAUSE {SL} AS IT'S AS BECAUSE YOU SEE ARROWS AND IT HAS ARROWS BECAUSE IT HAS ARROWS IT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH OK {SL} WHAT IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM SEVEN TO TWO {BR} OH THERE'S NO WEIGHTS ON EACH EDGES THAT'S REALLY A TOUGHIE TO SAY UM {SL} I MEAN IF YOU'RE JUST SOLELY BASING THIS ON HOW TO GET THERE QUICKLY OH OR THE ONLY WAY FOR THAT MATTER YOU CAN ONLY GET THERE F- F- FOR THIS SITUATION UH BECAUSE OF HOW THESE GRAPHS ARE DIRECTED WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CANNOT GO THE REVERSE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE ARROW POINTS I'D HAVE TO SAY FIRST TRAVEL FROM NODE SEVEN TO NODE EIGHT THEN FROM NODE EIGHT TO NODE SIX THEN FROM NODE SIX TO NODE TWO {SL} OK {SL} WHAT IS A CYCLE ALSO CALLED A ROUTE OR A TOUR {SL} IT'S BASICALLY WHEN YOU UH {SL} IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IF THIS HAS WEIGHTS YOU'RE GONNA BE YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO TRY TO FIND AN ALGORITHM TO FIND THE SHORTEST PATH LET'S SAY FROM NODE A TO NODE B {SL} OK SO WHAT A CYCLE IS IS BASICALLY IF SOMEHOW DURING THE ALGORITHM THEY THE ALGORITHM SOMEHOW {SL} LEAPS UP AND UH {SL} IS TRYING TO FIND TWO INSTANCES OF A SHORTEST PATH THEN THERE'S GONNA BE A CYCLE BECAUSE {SL} BECAUSE THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE PATH FROM A TO B AND IF THERE IS ANOTHER NODE THAT'S TRYING TO INTERFERE WITH THAT PATH PER SE OR CONNECT TO THAT PATH UH EVEN THOUGH IT HAS ALREADY BEEN VISITED ONCE BUT IT'S TRYING TO BE VISITED A SECOND TIME THAT IS CONSIDERED A CYCLE OK HOW MANY CYCLES ARE IN THIS GRAPH {SL} I'M GONNA SAY {SL} THAT THERE ARE {SL} FOUR WHICH ARE NODES TWO THREE SEVEN AND NINE BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE THAN ONE ARROW POINTING AT THEM {SL} OK GREAT {SL} THIS IS A LIST OF SOME BIG-O NOTATIONS FOR ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY YES SO GIVING NAMES AND EXAMPLES WHERE YOU CAN DESCRIBE TO ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPLEXITIES {SL} SO O OF ONE WHICH IS {BR} IN MODERN TIMES THEY SUCH DOES NOT EXIST BUT O OF ONE IS BASICALLY A COMPLEXITY IT ONLY TAKES ONE SECOND TO COMPUTE UH FOR THAT ALGORITHM O OF N FACTORIAL WHICH IS WHAT THE EXCLAMATION POINT MEANS IS THAT IT TAKES UH YOU HAVE TO MULTIPLY N UH N MINUS N MINUS N MINUS ONE TIMES ALL THE WAY UP TO ONE SO YOU HAVE TO SAY LET'S SAY N IS EQUAL TO FIVE YOU'D GO FIVE BY FOUR BY THREE BY TWO BY ONE THAT WOULD BE THE COMPLEXITY O OF N VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD JUST {SL} IT'S AS C- THE TIME IT TAKES TO DO THE ACTUAL ALGORITHM IS EQUAL TO N ITSELF UH FOR LOG N O OF LOG N THEN IT'S EQUAL TO THE LOGARITHMIC VALUE BASE TWO {SL} I BELIEVE YES OF WHAT N'S VALUE IS EVEN IF N'S VALUE IS IN BASE TEN AND STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH N SQUARED IT TAKES N SQUARED SECONDS TO COMPLETE THE ALGORITHM {SL} OK WHICH TYPE OF COMPLEXITY IS BEST AND WHY {SL} IN THE IDEAL SENSE IT WOULD BE O OF ONE HOWEVER THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL FOR FOR ALL PURPOSES NECESSARY SO IN MODERN TIMES PEOPLE WOULD GO WITH O OF LOG N BECAUSE LOG N IS BASICALLY A VALUE THAT IS LESS THAN N WHEREAS ALL THE OTHER VALUES ARE EITHER EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN N BUT OF COURSE IN THE IDEAL WORLD O OF ONE WOULD BE MOST {SL} IDEAL FOR ALL ALGORITHMS NO MATTER WHAT BUT {SL} GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S O OF LOG N BECAUSE IT HAS THE {SL} SMALLEST NUMERIC VALUE {SL} OK MAKES SENSE {SL} WHAT IS A VERTEX AND HOW MANY VERTICES ARE THERE {SL} A VERTEX IS BASICALLY A CONNECTED A CONNECTION POINT BETWEEN UH {SL} EACH EDGE OR IT COULD BE LIKE {SL} YES IT'S IT'S UM {BR} {SL} YES A VERTEX IS BASICALLY A LINE THAT CONNECTS EACH EDGE OR A NODE WHICH IS THE TERM I HAD PREVIOUSLY USED SO IN THIS PICTURE THERE ARE TWELVE VERTICES {SL} OK WHAT IS AN EDGE AND HOW MANY EDGES ARE THERE AN EDGE IS THE TERM I USED FOR NODE SO IT'S BASICALLY IN THIS CASE WHAT IS REPRESENTED AS THE COLORED CIRCLES AND THERE ARE A TOTAL OF EIGHT {SL} HOW LONG IS THE SHORTEST PATH FROM ONE TO SIX {SL} I MEAN BECAUSE THE VERTICES ARE NOT WEIGHTED I E THEY HAVE NO NUMERICAL VALUE TO THEM {SL} UH IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL SO ONE COULD SAY PERHAPS IT'S FROM ONE TO FIVE TO SIX OR FROM ONE TO TWO TO SIX BUT REALLY THERE'S NO FAIR WAY OF JUSTIFYING WHICH IS THE SHORTEST PATH IN THIS IMAGE BECAUSE THERE'S NO WEIGHTS ON THE VERTICES {SL} OK AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT THREE AND TWO ARE ADJACENT {SL} {BR} ESSENTIALLY {SL} AS THE NAME SUGGESTS THEY ARE JUST NEXT TO EACH OTHER THEY ARE CONNECTED SOMEHOW THEY HAVE A BOND SO IN THIS CASE THIS BOND IS A VERTICE THAT CONNECTS BETWEEN TWO AND THREE {SL} OK {SL} GREAT {SL} ALRIGHT SO THAT'S IT UM FOR THE QUESTIONS SO WE JUST NEED TO HAVE YOU CALIBRATE THE EYE TRACKING GLASSES ONE MORE TIME AND THEN WE'RE ALMOST DONE OK {SL} ALRIGHT SO WE ARE ALL DONE UM YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND
